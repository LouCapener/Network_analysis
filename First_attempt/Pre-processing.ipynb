Christopher Columbus discovered America and was the Indians\\' best friend. He helped the Indians win their war against Fredrick Douglass and a freed the Hebrews from Napoleon and discovered France. And then in 1492, Columbus started a restaurant...[He is drowned out by Kyle\\'s voice.]\\nKyle\\n[Whispering.] Oh, man. I can\\'t just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I\\'ll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, \"Where\\'s your brother, Kyle?\" \"You weren\\'t looking out for your little brother, Kyle?\"\\nStan\\n[Whispering.] Okay, okay, let\\'s ditch school and go find him.\\nKyle\\n[His voice is rising to an audible level.] \"You know he can\\'t think on his own, Kyle!\" \"Brush and floss, Kyle!\" \"Where has that finger been, Kyle?\"\\nStan\\nDude!\\nMr. Garrison\\nIs there a problem, boys?\\nKyle\\nYes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now.\\nMr. Garrison\\nOh, really, Kyle? What is it this time? Another prostate tumor?\\nKyle\\nNo, my little brother\\'s been abducted by aliens. [Silence.] It\\'s true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe.\\nCartman\\n[Embarrassed.] Heh, heh, that\\'s a, that\\'s, that\\'s a little joke. Heh, heh.\\nKyle\\n[Kyle walks up to Mr. Garrison\\'s desk.] Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?\\nMr. Garrison\\nI don\\'t know, Kyle. Did you ask Mr. Hat?\\nKyle\\nI don\\'t want to ask Mr. Hat, I\\'m asking you!\\nMr. Garrison\\nOh I think you should ask Mr. Hat.\\nKyle\\nMr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?\\nMr. Hat\\nWell, Kyle, NO!! You hear me?! You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!\\nMr. Garrison\\nHmm, guess you\\'ll have to take your seat, Kyle.\\nKyle\\n[shouts frustratedly] Damn it!\\nCartman\\nHah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you.\\nCartman farts fire. Poor Pip is stunned.\\nCartman\\nOw! My ass!\\nThe class gasps.\\nStan\\nDude!\\nKyle\\nDamn, Cartman!\\nCartman\\n[Cartman farts fire again.] Uh... Ow! My ass!\\nKyle\\nDude, he\\'s farting fire!\\nStan\\nIt\\'s the alien anal probe. It\\'s shooting fire from Cartman\\'s rectum!\\nCartman\\nNo, that was just a dream.\\nMr. Garrison\\nEric, do you need to sit in the corner until your flaming gas is under control?\\nCartman\\nNo, Mr. Garrison, I\\'m fine.\\nCartman farts fire again, setting Pip aflame. Pip runs around the room on fire.\\nTrain station. Cows flock in from all around and stand in line, waiting to board the train out of town.\\nTrain conductor\\nHey, you cows can\\'t get on this train! This is a people train. You cows have no business on a people train, all right? \\'Cause you\\'re cows.\\nThe cows are all staring at the conductor.\\nTrain conductor\\nNo, no, no. Don\\'t try any of that cow hypnosis on me, all right? \\'Cause it\\'s not gonna work.\\nOfficer Barbrady\\n[Drives by with his lights flashing.] Hold it right there, cows!\\nCows split up and run off mooing.\\nOfficer Barbrady\\nCome back here! Now then! [He pursues them.]\\nCafeteria\\nKid\\nSo then I had bad, bad gas.\\nJason\\nYa, seriously, killer.\\nCartman\\n[Cartman farts fire.] Oh!! Whoa, I sure am hungry.\\nStan\\nHow can you eat when you\\'re farting fire?\\nCartman\\nShut up, dude, you\\'re being totally immature.\\nKyle\\nHey, look, there\\'s Wendy Testaburger.\\nStan\\n[Gasps.] Where?\\nHe finds himself looking right at her. An epiphany plays while hearts dance around Stan\\'s head. Stan smiles, and it soon goes from ear to ear\\nCartman\\n[Singing.] Stan wants to ki-iss Wendy Testabur-ger.\\nStan\\nShut up, fat ass! I don\\'t even like her!\\nCartman\\nI\\'m not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.\\nStan\\nI do not!\\nWendy Testaburger\\nHi, guys.\\nKyle, Cartman\\nHi, Wendy.\\nWendy\\nHere, Stan. This is for you. [Wendy hands Stan a note.]\\nStan\\nBleech!\\nWendy\\nEww! [She leaves.]\\nKyle, Cartman\\n[Their eyes follow her out.] Bye, Wendy.\\nKyle\\nDude, what does the note say?\\nStan\\n[He glances at it.] Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark\\'s Pond after school.\\nA look of wonder comes over his face.\\nKyle\\nWhoa! Maybe you can kiss her.\\nCartman\\nOr slip her the tongue.\\nKenny\\n(Or look at the cat on her feet, then touch her.)\\nStan\\n[That gets his attention.] What? How do you know she has a cat?\\nSilence, Kenny waits to see if the other guys got the message, then laughs. The rest follow, realizing what Kenny meant.\\nKyle\\nCome on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back.\\nThe cafeteria kitchen. Chef stands behind the counter, ready to serve food. The boys enter.\\nChef\\nHello there, children.\\nBoys\\nHey, Chef.\\nChef\\nHow are you doing?\\nKyle\\nBad.\\nChef\\nWhy bad?\\nKyle\\nChef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?\\nChef\\nOh, children, children, that\\'s a problem we\\'ve all had to face at some time or another. Here, let me sing you a little song. It might clear things up.\\nI\\'m gonna make love to you woman\\nGonna lay you down by the fire\\nAnd caress your womanly body\\nMake you moooooan and perspi-yah!\\nGonna--\\nStan\\nUh, Chef?\\nChef\\n--get those juices flowin\\'--\\nStan\\nChef.\\nChef\\n--we\\'re makin\\' love gravy--\\nStan\\nChef!\\nChef\\n--love gravy, lovelovelovelovelove gravih!\\nStan\\n[shouts loud enough for Chef to hear] CHEF!!!\\nChef\\nLove luh--\\nHuh?\\nSilence. Kenny nods towards Kyle.\\nChef\\nDo you feel better?\\nKyle\\nNo!\\nChef\\nOh, come on children, what could be so bad? It\\'s Salisbury steak day.\\nStan\\nVisitors took Kyle\\'s baby brother.\\nChef\\nWhat?!\\nChef tosses a food tray aside and runs to the other side of the counter.\\nChef\\nWhat the hell do you think you\\'re doing in school eatin\\' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!\\nKyle\\nMr. Garrison won\\'t let us out of school. He thinks we\\'re making it up.\\nCartman\\nYou are making it up.\\nCartman farts more fire, the anal probe pops out, moves around and puts its metal arms on its hip, looking annoyed at Cartman\\'s determination that it didn\\'t happen.\\nStan\\nWhoa!\\nThe probe goes back into Cartman\\'s ass.\\nCartman\\nWhat?\\nKyle\\nThat was cool!\\nChef\\nIt\\'s uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device.\\nCartman turns about so Chef can check out the probe.\\nChef\\nThis could mean the Visitors want to communicate with us.\\nCartman\\n[Turning to face Chef, testily.] Oh, I see. Now you\\'re going to join in on the little joke huh?\\nChef\\nIt\\'s no joke, children, this is big!\\nKyle\\nPlease, Chef, if I don\\'t get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me.\\nChef\\nUuh, hold on now, hold on now. [To himself.] Uhyouyouyou you gotta help the children.\\nCartman\\nOh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak!\\nChef\\n[Pulling on the fire alarm] Fire drill! Fire drill! Everybody out! [To the boys.] Okay children, this is your chance!\\nStan\\nKiller! Thanks, Chef.\\nChef\\nMahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien Visitors. I\\'ve got to get myself ready.\\nThe boys\\' neighborhood.\\nBoys\\n[Singing.]\\nWe got out of school,\\nNo more school today,\\nWe got out of school...\\nCartman, interrupting the song with a fiery fart.\\nCartman\\nOh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..!\\nStan\\nOkay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.\\nCartman\\nI would if I could, you son of a bitch!\\nKyle\\nOkay, so how do we get my little brother back?\\nCartman\\nUh—Would you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn\\'t have an anal probe, and I know that I\\'m not under alien control!\\na radio wave strikes Cartman and he gets big blushy cheeks and starts to sing.\\nCartman\\nI love to singa,\\nAbout the moon-a and the June-a and the Spring-a,\\nI love to sing-a,\\nAbout a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a...\\nA second radio wave reverts him to normal and all is quiet. Dogs bark in the background.\\nStan\\nWhat the hell was that?\\nKyle\\nHe is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the Visitors!\\nCartman\\nAh, son of a bitch!\\nCartman\\nYou guys, shut up. I\\'m not under alien control.\\nKyle yells into Cartman\\'s ear. His voice echoes.\\nKyle\\nHey!\\nCartman\\nUh...\\nKyle\\nIf you Visitors can hear me-\\nThe voice echoes in Cartman\\'s head.\\nCartman\\nHey...\\nKyle\\n-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!\\nCartman\\nOw! [Faces Kyle.] That hurts, you buttlicker!\\nStan notices a spaceship, hovering overhead and facing away.\\nStan\\nKyle, look! It\\'s them.\\nKyle\\nGive me back my brother!\\nKyle throws a rock at the spaceship. It quickly turns around to face the kids and fires back with a flash of light, hitting Kenny and knocking him into the road.\\nStan\\nOh my God! They killed Kenny!\\nKyle\\nYou bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!\\nThe spaceship turns away and leaves.\\nKyle\\nDamn it, we were so close!\\nStan\\nHey look, [Kenny gets up.] I think Kenny\\'s okay.\\nKenny\\n(Don\\'t worry, I\\'m alright. Argh!)\\nThe fleeing cows run over Kenny.\\nStan\\nOwww.\\nKenny\\n[He gets up again.] (Nope, I\\'m all fine. Agh!)\\nOfficer Barbrady mows him down with his police cruiser. Kenny ends up along the curb, lifeless. The boys approach.\\nStan\\nWow, poor Kenny.\\nKyle\\nNow do you believe us, Cartman?\\nCartman\\nNo!\\nKyle\\nCartman, they killed Kenny!\\nCartman\\nHe\\'s not dead.\\nStan\\nDude, Kenny is dead!\\nStan picks up a stick and hits Kenny\\'s bloody body.\\nStan\\nSee?\\nCartman\\nShut up, you guys.\\nKyle\\nHe\\'s dead, Cartman!\\nKyle pulls Kenny\\'s head off his body.\\nCartman\\nGod damn it, I didn\\'t have an anal probe! [He walks off.] Screw you guys, I\\'m goin\\' home.\\nKyle\\nGo on and go home, you fat chicken!\\nCartman\\n[Off screen.] Dildo!\\nKyle\\nYou\\'re all I have left, Stan.\\nStan\\nSorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.\\nKyle\\nYou can\\'t! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude!\\nRats feast upon Kenny\\'s body.\\nStan\\nDude, like Chef says, I\\'ve gotta get a piece of lovin\\' while the gettin\\'s hot. [He hurries away.]\\nRats drag Kenny\\'s head off.\\nKyle\\nRats.\\nCartman\\'s house.\\nLiane Cartman\\nHello, Eric.\\nCartman\\nHi, Mom.\\nLiane\\nHow are you doing?\\nCartman\\nWell, I\\'m pissed off!\\nLiane\\nHere, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise.\\nCartman\\nI don\\'t want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!\\nLiane\\nYou\\'re not fat, you\\'re big boned.\\nCartman\\nThat\\'s what I said.\\nLiane\\nYou can have an eensy weensy bit, can\\'t you?\\nCartman\\nNo!\\nLiane\\nJust a weensy eensy woo woo?\\nCartman\\nNo, leave me alone mom! [He walks past her.]\\nLiane\\nHow about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?\\nCartman\\n[He stops in his tracks.] What? Well, that does sound pretty good.\\nHe returns to sit on the sofa while his mom goes off to get the pie.\\nCartman\\nUh, Mom?\\nLiane\\nYes, hon?\\nCartman\\nIf anybody calls or comes over, I\\'m not here, okay?\\nLiane\\nSure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too?\\nCartman is in disbelief she even asked.\\nCartman\\nYeah, I want Cheesy Poofs.\\nStark\\'s Pond. Kyle decided to join Stan.\\nKyle\\nWell, it looks like she\\'s not going to show up, Stan. Let\\'s go look for the Visitors now.\\nStan\\nBut her note said she\\'d be here.\\nWendy appears out of nowhere.\\nWendy\\nHi, Stan.\\nStan\\nBleech!\\nWendy\\nEww!\\nKyle\\nYou can\\'t talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do.\\nWendy\\nBut why, Stan?\\nStan tries to hold it in.\\nStan\\nBleech!\\nWendy\\nEww!\\nKyle\\nLook, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?\\nWendy\\n[Turns to Kyle.] Huh?\\nKyle\\nJust make sweet love down by the fire.\\nWendy\\nWhat happened to your little brother?\\nCartman\\'s house. Cartman is on the sofa watching TV.\\nNews reporter\\nAs the reports of UFO sightings increase, more mysterious crop circle patterns are appearing in fields all around South Park. These crop circles, when viewed from above, form strange patterns.\\nA plane circles around a field with odd patterns on it, and a cameraman pans out to reveal the outline of Cartman.\\nCartman\\nHey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck.\\nNews reporter\\nCould it be that aliens are trying to make contact with us, here on Earth?\\nMr. Kitty\\nMeow.\\nNoticing Mr. Kitty eyeing his pot pie.\\nCartman\\nNo, Kitty, this is mah pot pie.\\nMr. Kitty\\nMeow.\\nCartman\\nNo, Kitty, that\\'s a bad kitt--!\\nMr. Kitty\\nMeow.\\nCartman\\nNo, Kitty, it\\'s mah pot pie!\\nKitty hisses.\\nCartman\\nMom! Kitty\\'s being a dildo!\\nLiane peeks in suggestively.\\nLiane\\nWell, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who\\'s sleeping with Mommy tonight!\\nCartman\\n[Confused.] What?\\nStark\\'s Pond. Kyle is explaining what happened to his little brother.\\nKyle\\n...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.\\nWendy\\nWell, why don\\'t you go get the fat kid?\\nKyle\\nWhy?\\nWendy\\nWell, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the Visitors are using him as part of their plan. You should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back.\\nKyle\\nHey. You\\'re right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman. [He moves out.]\\nWendy\\nCome on, Stan. [She walks past him, following Kyle.]\\nStan\\nBleech!\\nWendy\\nEww! [She walks away.]\\nStan\\nHey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love?\\nA bird flies into his puke and starts waddling around in it.\\nCartman\\'s House, a short time later.\\nMr. Kitty\\nMeow.\\nCartman\\nNo, Kitty, you can\\'t have any!\\nMr. Kitty\\nMeow.\\nCartman\\nNo, Kitty, this is mah pot pie! Bad Kitty--!\\nCartman farts fire, setting the cat ablaze.\\nCartman\\nEh, \\'scuse me, Kitty.\\nLiane enters the room with Kyle, Stan, and Wendy.\\nLiane\\nEric, look who\\'s here.\\nCartman\\nDude, weak mom.\\nKyle\\nCome on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.\\nCartman\\nI can\\'t, my mom said...\\nLiane\\nThat\\'s okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends.\\nCartman\\n[Quietly.] But mom, I don\\'t want to spend time with my little friends--\\nLiane\\n[Stern.] Don\\'t be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow.\\nCartman\\nGod damn it!\\nMr. Kitty then runs by in flames.\\nForest at night. Cartman\\'s right foot is tied to a tree.\\nCartman\\nYou guys, I have to get home.\\nStan\\nDon\\'t be such a fraidy-cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can\\'t take you on board again.\\nCartman tugs his foot testing the rope.\\nCartman\\nOh, man, this sucks.\\nKyle\\nHow come the Visitors aren\\'t coming for him?\\nStan\\nI think we have to signal them somehow.\\nCartman\\n[Cartman farts fire.] Ow!\\nWendy\\nHey, he\\'s like Rudolph.\\nKyle\\nYeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the Visitors are sure to come!\\nCartman\\nReally? Uh, I don\\'t think I have to fart anymore tonight.\\nKyle\\nSure you do!\\nStan\\nCome on Cartman, fart!\\nCartman\\nI don\\'t wanna.\\nStan\\n[To Kyle and Wendy.] He can\\'t hold it in forever.\\nKyle\\nFart, damn you!\\nCartman\\nOkay, that\\'s does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!\\nFarts. An anal probe comes out of his butt and expands.\\nCartman\\nI\\'m sick of it! It\\'s completely immature.\\nStan\\nHey, it\\'s happening again.\\nThe probe is now a large satellite dish.\\nKyle\\nWhoa, look at that.\\nStan\\nNow, do you believe us, Cartman?\\nCartman\\nYou guys can\\'t scare me! I know you\\'re making it all up.\\nStan\\nCartman, there\\'s a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!\\nCartman\\nSure, you guys, what-ever.\\nThe dish sends a radio signal out to space.\\nChef\\'s yard. He\\'s sitting in a lawn chair with a can of ZOOP in his hand. An Igloo cooler is next to him.\\nChef\\nOh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom! [He looks at his watch.] And you\\'ve only got 20 minutes before Sanford and Son is on.\\nForest.\\nCartman\\nYou guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens!\\nThree small ships descend, followed by a mother-ship.\\nCartman\\nOh, God damn it!\\nMr. Garrison\\n[Driving by, he stops.] What the? I tell you, there\\'s some crazy stuff going on in this town.\\nMr. Hat\\nYou can say that again, Mr. Garrison.\\nStan\\nCome down here, you stinking aliens! [Three Visitors appear.]\\nKyle\\nUh, uh...\\nStan\\nGo on, Kyle, ask \\'em for your little brother back.\\nKyle\\nVi, Visitors, this morning you took my brother, Ike. He\\'s the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I\\'ve learned something today. That having a little brother... i- is a pretty special thing.\\nStan\\nYeah.\\nKyle\\nAh, heck, Mr. Visitors, I\\'m just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.\\nStan\\nThat was beautiful, dude.\\nKyle\\nDid it work?\\nStan\\nNo, they\\'re leaving.\\nKyle\\nHey, you scrawny-eyed shits, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!\\nStan\\nWhoa, dude!\\nKyle\\nYou know what you fuckers like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!\\nStan\\nHey Wendy, what\\'s a fuck? [She shrugs.]\\nThe spaceship door opens.\\nIke\\nHelp me doy tair.\\nKyle\\nIke, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!\\nIke\\nDon\\'t hurt me.\\nA herd of cows runs away from the ship, but a trio of Visitors stops them in their tracks. The cows moo and quiver with fear until the middle Visitor raises its hand and addresses them.\\nVisitor\\nMoo... Moo...Moo moo, moo moo... (Greetings, cows of Earth. We come in peace.)\\nCows\\nMoo?? (Really??)\\nKyle\\nCome on, Ike! I promise I\\'ll be nice to you from now on!\\nIke\\nDon\\'t kick the baby.\\nVisitor\\nMoo moo, moo. Moo moo, moo. Moo. (We have experimented with all the beings of Earth, and we have learned that you are the most intelligent and wise.)\\nCartman\\nWhat the hell are they talking about?\\nCow\\nMoo moo? (Why did you turn some of us inside out?)\\nVisitor\\nMoo moo, moo. Moo. (Oh, that was Carl\\'s fault. He\\'s new.)\\nVisitor Carl\\nMoo...moo...moo moo. (Yeah, sorry about that. My bad!)\\nKyle\\nIke!\\nVisitor\\nMoo moo. Moo moo. Moo. (Take this device. It is a gift from us.)\\nThe cows look at each other and moo in agreement.\\nKyle\\nIke! Do your impersonation of David Caruso\\'s career!\\nIke\\nIt\\'s my turn!\\nIke dives from the ship into the snow. The satellite goes back into Cartman\\'s butt.\\nVisitor\\nMoo moo. Moo moo. (Farewell cows, peace be with you!)\\nThe Visitors disappear. The spaceship pulls Cartman up but the rope keeps him grounded.\\nCartman\\nYou guys, get me down from here!\\nHe farts fire, burning the rope. The tractor beam takes him into the ship and the spaceship flies away.\\nCartman\\nOw! Help! Sons o\\' bitches! Dildos!\\nStan\\nPhew, I\\'m sure glad that\\'s over with.\\nKyle\\nYeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike.\\nIke\\nOh, he fly out the sky.\\nChef\\'s yard.\\nChef\\nWait, where are you going, alien Visitors? Come back!\\nA blonde arrives with a brunette.\\nBlonde\\nWell, Chef, where\\'s this amazing thing you were going to show us.\\nChef\\nWell, i- it\\'s in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in.\\nForest.\\nKyle\\nCome on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. [They leave.]\\nStan\\nThanks for your help, Wendy.\\nWendy\\nWhatever, dude.\\nStan\\nHey, I didn\\'t throw up.\\nWendy\\nCool!\\nShe\\'s happy now. They both look at each other like they\\'re going to kiss, and that music plays again. Wendy puckers up. Stan gets queasy.\\nStan\\nBleech!\\nHe barfs right on her face.\\nWendy\\nEww!\\nStan\\nSorry.\\nWendy\\nHey, look. A French fry.\\nStan\\nCool.\\nWendy\\nAnd what is that?\\nStan\\nI think it\\'s part of a Cheesy Poof.\\nChef\\'s song starts up and the camera pulls away.\\nWendy\\nHey, what\\'s that?\\nStan\\nThat\\'s uummm... a hamburger from... that\\'s from, like, two days ago.\\nWendy\\nOh hey, what about that?\\nStan\\nI don\\'t know what the hell that is...\\nBus Stop.\\nStan\\nGee, the bus\\'ll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn\\'t around.\\nKyle\\nYeah, we\\'re running out of friends.\\nStan\\nI wonder what that thing was that the Visitors gave the cows.\\nCows out on a pasture.\\nCows\\nMooo.\\nOfficer Barbrady\\nHa ha cows! I\\'ve got you cornered. Let\\'s see you get away now.\\nOne of the cows steps on the plate on the Visitor\\'s device. A beam from the device strikes Officer Barbrady. His glasses fly off, and cheeks become rosy.\\nOfficer Barbrady\\nI love to sing-a,\\nAbout the moon-a and the June-a and the Spring-a,\\nI love to sing-a,\\nAbout a sky of blue-a or a tea for...\\nThe cows begin hopping about gleefully.\\nBus Stop. Cartman falls out of the sky, landing on his side next to Kyle and Stan.\\nCartman\\nPuh!\\nStan\\nOh, hey Cartman.\\nKyle\\nWow Cartman, the Visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.\\nCartman\\nAh, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night.\\nStan\\nReally, what about?\\nCartman\\nWell, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there was... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.\\nStan\\nThat wasn\\'t a dream, Cartman. That really happened.\\nCartman\\n[Sarcastically.] Oh right, [Matter of factly.] why don\\'t I have pinkeye then?\\nKyle\\nCartman, you do have pinkeye!\\nCartman\\nAhh, son of a bitch!\\nEnd of Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\\n101: \"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\"\\nedit\\nStory Elements\\nEric Cartman •\\nKyle Broflovski •\\nStan Marsh •\\nKenny McCormick •\\nIke Broflovski •\\nJerome \"Chef\" McElroy •\\nHerbert Garrison •\\nVisitors •\\nMr. Kitty •\\nAnal Probe •\\nSouth Park Elementary •\\n\"I\\'m Gonna Make Love to You, Woman\" •\\n\"I Love to Singa\" •\\n\"School Days\"\\nMedia\\nImages •\\nScript •\\nExtras •\\nWatch Episode\\nRelease\\nSouth Park: The Complete First Season • South Park Volume 1 • South Park Volume 1 (VHS)\\nCategories\\nCategories:\\nScripts\\nSeason 1\\nScripts From Season One\\nLanguages\\nEspañol\\nFrançais\\n日本語\\nPolski\\nРусский\\n中文\\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.\\nAdvertisement\\nFan Feed\\nMore South Park Archives\\n1\\nKenny McCormick\\n2\\nKyle Broflovski\\n3\\nEric Cartman\\nExplore properties\\nFandom\\nMuthead\\nFanatical\\nFollow Us\\nOverview\\nWhat is Fandom?\\nAbout\\nCareers\\nPress\\nContact\\nTerms of Use\\nPrivacy Policy\\nDigital Services Act\\nGlobal Sitemap\\nLocal Sitemap\\nCookie Preferences\\nCommunity\\nCommunity Central\\nSupport\\nHelp\\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\\nAdvertise\\nMedia Kit\\nContact\\nFandom Apps\\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\\nSouth Park Archives is a FANDOM TV Community.\\nView Mobile Site\\nFollow on IG\\nTikTok\\nJoin Fan Lab'"

The Marshes sit at table and Randy comes in with laptop and coffee\\nRandy\\nGood morning, everyone. \\'morning. So, listen guys. We are not in good shape. The whole \"doing business in China\" thing has sort of bitten us in the ass, [the projector screen comes on.] and now we aren\\'t selling enough weed to keep up with our costs. [turns to look at a growth chart projected on a portable screen behind him.] You see this? This right here? That\\'s us plateauing. We no longer get any of that sweet Chinese money, and now, all the money we do make doesn\\'t even cover our expenses. [the same chart is on the laptop he was looking at earlier] So, [turns back to the table] how do we sell more weed? Stan.\\nStan\\n[after several seconds] I don\\'t know... Do like a sale. Like, a Fall sale?\\nRandy\\nNot good enough! Shelly?!\\nShelly\\nI hate marijuana.\\nRandy\\nNice attitude! How do we sell more weed? Sharon?\\nSharon\\nIf you don\\'t make commercials or do more parades for the town, we\\'d have more money.\\nRandy\\nRight. Cut out all our marketing. That\\'s Sharon\\'s great idea, everyone. Towelie?\\nTowelie\\nYou know what the problem is? It\\'s the schwag. All those stands and seeds, they just go to waste, man.\\nRandy\\nGo on.\\nTowelie\\nIt\\'s like, we sell all the good parts of the weed, but we throw away, like, tons and tons of all the leftover shit. You can sell that crap as mulch to a hardware company.\\nRandy\\nMulch. [looks at the graph] Use our discarded product to recover costs. [to the table] Everyone, great job. You just got powned by a towel.\\nThe school cafeteria, lunchtime. The students stand in line to get their lunches in the kitchen.\\nCartman\\n\\'[singing]\\' It\\'s Sloppy Joe day!\\nCartman and Butters\\n\\'[singing]\\' It\\'s Sloppy Joe day!\\nCartman\\nI seriously think that Sloppy Joe day is my favorite day at school.\\nButters\\nYeah, it\\'s the best.\\nCartman and Butters\\n\\'[singing]\\' Sloppy Joe day! It\\'s Sloppy Joe day!\\nA new Cook\\nCome on, keep the line moving, kids! [in view are Butters, Cartman , and Scott. Cartman notices that what he sees on his plate doesn\\'t look like sloppy Joe.]\\nCartman\\nWhat is this?\\nCook\\nThat\\'s today\\'s lunch. It\\'s \"feesh.\"\\nCartman\\nFeesh?\\nButters\\nBut, but this is Sloppy Joe day.\\nCook\\nYeah? Well, the menu\\'s been changed. We had kids complainin\\' our food wasn\\'t healthy or sustainable enough, so don\\'t you start bitchin\\' about it now.\\nCartman\\nWhat kids were complaining about health and sustainability?! What kids would care at all that- [gasps] the girls!\\nButters\\nThe girls?\\nCartman\\nThe fucking girls! [the three boys walk over to the girls\\' table] Excuse me?! Can someone explain to us why this [holds forth his lunch] is on our lunch trays?!\\nButters\\nYeah, it\\'s supposed to be sloppy Joe day!\\nWendy\\nWe asked for healthier options and to sometimes have food for those of us who don\\'t eat red meat.\\nCartman\\nOh my God. I\\'m about to lose my mind. [gets excited] You think you can just mess with a man\\'s lunch?!\\nButters\\nIt\\'s okay, Eric. I-\\nCartman\\nYou think that your ideas about health and nutrition should be somehow interfering with mine?!\\nButters\\nEric, Eric!\\nCartman\\nYou dictate what foods I can eat?! [convulses] Urgh [the tray falls to the floor. He stiffens up and tries to reach for anything]\\nButters\\nEric, Eric?\\nCartman\\nI can\\'t, I can\\'t. Butters, I can\\'t. [falls back, smacking Butters\\' tray on the way down. Butters\\' meal lands on him]\\nSouth Park Elementary, front lawn. An ambulance waits as Cartman is being loaded up into it. The rest of the school stands around looking at this incident. Two paramedics treat him. The brunette, Smith, puts some defibrillators on and gets ready to deliver a jolt\\nParamedic 1\\nClear! [the brunette delivers the jolt, then they both look at the EKG]\\nSmith\\nWe got him back!\\nCartman\\nAgh. Fuck you, Wendy.\\nAs Cartman is being taken to Hell\\'s Pass Hospital, Randy drives into town with a huge load of Tegridy weed; he and Towelie share a joint. Cypress Hill plays during this segment.\\nRandy\\nHow much do you think we\\'ll get for our mulch?\\nTowelie\\nEven if we only get 10 cents a pound, we have like a million pounds of it.\\nRandy\\nThis is gonna save our business. I\\'m really hungry all of a sudden. You want some Burger King?\\nTowelie\\nYeah, I\\'ll take some onion rings. [Randy pulls into a parking spot and goes inside.]\\nBurger King, inside. Randy steps forward to place his order\\nClerk\\nWelcome to Burger King. Can I take your order?\\nRandy\\nUh, hi, can I get, um, large onion rings... the big Coke Zero and, um... What\\'s an Impossible Burger?\\nClerk\\nIt\\'s a plant-based burger, sir.\\nRandy\\nPlant-based? You mean, it\\'s not like a cow?\\nClerk\\nNo, sir. It\\'s completely vegan, but it\\'s engineered to replicate the taste and texture of beef.\\nRandy\\nHoh. Okay, I\\'ll try it. [hands his debit card over. The clerk turns the card through the reader and hand it back. He also hands Randy the receipt and the burger. Randy takes a bite of the burger and savors it] Hey. This tastes like shit. You guys make money off of this?\\nClerk\\nThey\\'re very popular, sir. A lot of people care about the environment and sustainability.\\nRandy\\nAw that, that\\'s amazing. I mean, this seriously tastes like dog shit, and you get people to buy it? [gets an idea] Wait a minute... Plant-based... Plant... based... Plant-based. Oh my God.\\nSouth Park Elementary, day. The kids are in the hallways. Cartman is in a wheelchair; Butters drives him around\\nButters\\nComin\\' through! Make way! [the stop by Tolkien, Jimmy, and Craig]\\nCartman\\nHey guys. How\\'s it goin\\'?\\nCraig\\nYou\\'re out of the hospital?\\nCartman\\nYes. The girls tried to kill me, but they did not succeed. However, we cannot let the girls\\' protest ruin our lunch ever again!\\nNichole\\nOh, give me a break! [arrives from her locker] It\\'s not just girls who wanna change the menu, it\\'s boys too!\\nBoy\\nYeah. I want vegan food.\\nMillie\\nA lot of students are protesting!\\nCartman\\nWell, their protesting is ruining my lunch!\\nBoy\\nWe have a right to free speech.\\nCartman\\nYes, we do all have freedom of speech! But at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\\'re not thinking about others and you\\'re ONLY THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF!\\nMr. Mackey\\n[arriving] Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what\\'s goin\\' on, kids?\\nButters\\nThe protesters are tryin\\' to kill Eric again, Mr. Mackey.\\nMr. Mackey\\nOkay, kids, we don\\'t want another incident here, okay?\\nCartman\\nThey\\'re trying to take people\\'s lunch! They don\\'t realize it harms people financially, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. [begins to choke]\\nMr. Mackey\\nEric, it\\'s okay. We aren\\'t going to change the school menu, okay? Everything\\'s fine.\\nBoy\\nThat\\'s not fair!\\nNichole\\nDoesn\\'t it matter we\\'re being silenced?!\\nCartman\\nAgagagh, my lunch!\\nMr. Mackey\\nGirls, I\\'m sorry, but the health of our students has to come first.\\nTegridy Farms, day. Gerald shows up at the front door and knocks. Randy answers the door\\nRandy\\nGerald, thanks for coming! You\\'re not gonna believe this!\\nGerald\\nBelieve what? Your text said that-\\nRandy\\nCome on come on come on. [pulls him in. Next scene is in the kitchen. They go to the table, on which sit two burgers] I think I\\'ve perfected it, Gerald. I made a sustainable, healthy alternative to meat. I want you to try it. [hands a burger to Gerald]\\nGerald\\nIt\\'s a hamburger?\\nRandy\\nIt\\'s a Tegridy burger. Go ahead, try it. [Gerald takes a bite and chews it for a few seconds] Well?\\nGerald\\nThis tastes like shit.\\nRandy\\nYeah. It\\'s plant-based. But keep eating it, though.\\nGerald\\n[through the chewing] I just- I just don\\'t think it\\'s very good.\\nRandy\\nWait for it. Wait for it...\\nGerald\\n[gets a small epiphany] Oh. [starts to giggle, then Randy joins in]\\nRandy\\nYeah ha ha?\\nGerald\\nYeah, it\\'s good.\\nRandy\\nYeah, right?\\nGerald\\n[takes another bite and chews on it] Whoa. It\\'s really fucking good, man! This is like the best burger I\\'ve ever had!\\nRandy\\nAnd you can eat a lot of them and not feel bloated. Towelie\\'s had like 12. [points to Towelie, who\\'s reclining against a cabinet eating a Tegridy burger.]\\nTowelie\\nBest burgers I ever had.\\nThe school cafeteria, lunch. Cartman is back a table with the other boys, and they\\'re all eating barbecue ribs with corn on the cob and cole slaw. Cartman is still in his hospital gown, which means his back side is exposed. He\\'s also wearing the hospital bracelet\\nCartman\\n[savoring them ribs] Ohm... oh my God. School cafeteria ribs. After all that yogurt and crap they gave me at the hospital? OHM.\\nButters\\nI looove barbecue rib day.\\nCartman\\nYeah. I think maybe I like rib day even more than sloppy Joe day. It\\'s a difficult choice.\\nWendy\\nEveryone? Everyone, can I have your attention, please? [the students all stop eating and look at her] Look, guys. We\\'re supposed to be the young generation, right? We\\'re the ones upset about the world our parents left us.\\nNichole\\nYeah, but eating this kind of food makes us all just as guilty.\\nWendy\\nThe millions and millions of cows and pigs and chickens that we harvest every year [Cartman begins to tremble in anger] are a huge reason for climate change.\\nNichole\\nIt is up to us, as students, to protest for change.\\nBoy\\nYoung voices matter!\\nWendy\\nWithout sustainable and ethical food choices now, we\\'re proving to be no d-\\nCartman\\n[leaves the table] AAAH! GAAAH! [in the middle of the cafeteria, to Wendy] CAN I PLEASE JUST ENJOY MY LUNCH FOR FIVE GODDAMNED MINUTES?!\\nButters\\nYou gotta calm down, Eric. Remember your condition, Eric.\\nCartman\\nWe all have freedom of speech, but stop talking about climate change DURING LUNCH TIME!\\nButters\\nOkay. that\\'s it, Eric.\\nCartman\\nSome of us can just enjoy some simple goddamned barbecue ribs! And I- Daah! [stiffens up as anger overtakes him] Oh God, they did it again to me, Butters.\\nButters\\nEric!\\nCartman\\nI think this is the Big One! Don\\'t let me die.\\nButters\\nSomebody help!\\nCartman\\nDon\\'t let me die. Don\\'t let me die, Butters. [drops on his back.]\\nSouth Park Elementary, front lawn. An ambulance waits as Cartman is being loaded up into it. The rest of the school stands around looking at this incident. Two paramedics treat him. The brunette, Smith, puts some defibrillators on and gets ready to deliver a jolt\\nParamedic 1\\nClear! [the brunette delivers the jolt, then they both look at the EKG]\\nSmith\\nWe got him back!\\nCartman\\nAgh. Fuck you, Wendy.\\nBurger King, day, inside. A mother and son are at the counter\\nClerk\\nSo that\\'s one Whopper, one order of chicken strings, and a medium beverage. Is there any-? [stops when he hears someone outside]\\nRandy\\n[outside] Burgers! Get your burgers here!\\nClerk\\nUh okay, that\\'ll be fift-\\nRandy\\nPlant-based burgers for sale!\\nClerk\\nExcuse me one moment. [leaves the counter]\\nBurger King, day, outside. Randy has his burger stand up, selling $5 burgers that are all natural, plant based, and locally made\\nRandy\\nGet your hamburgers here! [a crowd begins to form] Plant-based burgers for sale!\\nClerk\\n[now outside] Hey, what are you doing?\\nRandy\\nI\\'m sellin\\' hamburgers. All-natural, completely plant-based. [a customer pays up and gets his burger] Thank you, sir.\\nClerk\\nYou can\\'t sell hamburgers here! This is a Burger King!\\nTowelie\\nYou sell hamburgers here.\\nRandy\\nYeah, you sell hamburgers here.\\nCustomer\\nThis is seriously as good or better than a real hamburger. Can I get a couple more to take to work?\\nClerk\\nHey! Now look, buddy! I\\'m not gonna lose customers because of YOU! [walks onto the parking lot] We have plant-based burgers inside as well! Come try our Impossible Burger.\\nRandy\\nTegridy Burger. Made locally right here in South Park. Tegridy Burger.\\nClerk\\nSTOP that!\\nThe school gym, day. PC Principal holds a student assembly\\nPC Principal\\nAlright everyone, listen up! As you know, there are several students protesting the school menu. But there are other students who are voicing their concerns against changes. Eric Cartman is still recovering in the hospital, we all wish him well. [clears his throat] Now, the school has been looking into several options to deal with the problem, and I do believe we have found a compromise. We have found a new company in the plant-based fast-food industry who would like to be the supplier for our cafeteria. And so please welcome the founder of Incredible Meat. [steps aside and claps for the founder, who steps in]\\nIncredible Meat founder\\nHello, children. I want to thank you and I want to thank your fine principal for hearing me out. I take plants, and I process them into goo. I\\'m a goo man. I have factories all over the country. I have trucks right now loaded with goo that can be here within the week. The goo I speak of can be made into anything. It can be made into tacos. It can be made into hot dogs. And I promise you that none of you students will know the difference. I would very much like to be the plant-based meat vendor for your school. I would like to be the plant-based meat vendor for your town. I\\'m a simple family man and a vegetarian. I would like the opportunity to make you all vegetarians as well, and I thank you.\\nPark County Community Center, day. Randy stands at the podium reading from index cards\\nRandy\\nEating meat doesn\\'t just hurt animals. It hurts people. It takes 13 pounds of grain to produce just one pound of animal meat. All that plant food could be used much more efficiently if-m, if people just ate it directly. Meat is also not environmentally friendly. Meat production is wasteful and causes enormous amounts of pollution. And the meat industry is one of the biggest... [after a few seconds, the camera finds him drifting away from the podium, Tegridy Burger in one hand, index cards in the other] ...Huh? Oh, I was just saying... [turns and walks back to the podium] that adopting a vegan diet is way more effective than switching to a greener car in the fight against climate change. For your health, for our planet, for the animals and for each other, we have to switch to plant-based foods. Now, it just so happens-\\nBurger King, day. The clerk is all alone now, having lost all his business to... He hears music outside and walks towards it\\nClerk\\nYou gotta be kidding me!\\n...Tegridy Burger. Randy\\'s hamburger stand is now a full-fledged fast-food restaurant\\nRandy\\n[through the PA system] It\\'s our Grand Opening! Come and visit your town\\'s only plant-based burger joint!\\nClerk\\nIt\\'s not the town\\'s only plant-based burger joint! [goes back to Burger King. Tegridy Burger is humming with activity]\\nRandy\\nCelebrate our Grand Opening! Tegridy Burger! Cheeba cheeba. Cheeba cheeba.\\nThe school cafeteria, day. Tolkien is at the entrance on the lookout\\nTolkien\\nHere he comes. [two seconds later, Cartman enters the cafeteria using a walker. He\\'s in his hospital gown. He sees all the other students staring at him. He turns right and goes to the kitchen]\\nCartman\\n[walks past Mr. Mackey] Mr. Mackey.\\nMr. Mackey\\n[nervously] Wuhuhuhu... hello, Eric.\\nCartman\\n[stands in line behind Butters] What\\'s goin\\' on, Butters? It\\'s taco Tuesday. [the line moves forward]\\nButters\\n[weakly] It\\'s taco Tuesday... [turns and walks forward. He gets his lunch, looks back at Eric, and heads for the boys table]\\nCartman\\nThese tacos look different. What kind are they?\\nCook\\nThey\\'re... Incredible Beef... tacos.\\nCartman\\nOh, Incredible Beef tacos. That sounds nice. [takes his tray and heads back to the cafeteria, where he again sees the students stare at him. He joins the other boys at the table. He looks around and the other students turn back to their meals. Nobody is talking. Cartman bites a taco and his friends look on. After 25 seconds...] Did you guys see that new Joker movie?\\nMr. Mackey\\nWhoa, uh, thank God it worked.\\nCity Wok, day. The goo man stands outside the restaurant and looks it over, then goes inside.\\nMr. Kim\\nWelcome City Wok. I take a order prease.\\nGoo Man\\nAre you the owner of this restaurant?\\nMr. Kim\\nYes. I take a order prease.\\nGoo Man\\nI\\'d like to do business with you. Your establishment here is perfect for my plant-based meats. You see, I am a goo man. If you carry my product, Incredible Meats, we can put the word Incredible before all of your dishes.\\nMr. Kim\\nYou mean instead of City Chicken I could have Incredibre City Chicken?\\nGoo Man\\nThat is correct.\\nMr. Kim\\nYou mean instead of City Mongorian Beef I could have Inrcedibry City Mongorian Beef?\\nGoo Man\\nThat\\'s right.\\nMr. Kim\\nYou\\'re saying now I could have scallops with Incredibry City XO sauce?! Okay, sign me up!\\nGoo Man\\nThat is most excellent. [gets out a pad and pen] Now, how many customers, on avarage, do you have per day?\\nMr. Kim\\nIncluding my wife? Uh, 0 to 1 per day.\\nGoo Man\\n[stunned] That\\'s it?\\nMr. Kim\\nYeah, I got no customers now that Tegridy Burger opened up. Everyone want plant-based food now. That why I\\'m ready you sign me up.\\nGoo Man\\nWhat is Tegridy Burger?\\nMr. Kim\\nYeah, here you look. Down the brock. [they walk to a window and look out] Most popular prace in town. [they look at the place for a few seconds]\\nGoo Man\\nIs that so?! [makes his way to the entrance and leaves]\\nMr. Kim\\nHey! [follows him out] Hey, what about my incredibry City chicken?\\nTegridy Farms, day. A farmer knocks on Randy\\'s door. Randy answers it\\nRancher\\nWhat\\'r you doin\\' you sonofabitch?\\nRandy\\nExcuse me?\\nRancher\\nI\\'m the biggest cattle rancher in South Park. I made ma livin\\' 62-odd years before you fancy plant growers done showed up and put me out of a job!\\nRandy\\nWell I\\'m sorry, Mr. Cow Killer, but this is called \"evolution.\"\\nRancher\\nI got 300 cows that the world suddenly decided they got no use fer! What am I supposed to do with them?! Put them in a zoo?! What they gonna do now? Go start some cow circus?! Go make some cow TV show?! You are single-handedly making cows extinct! You got a plan for \\'em all? Fine! [turns to whistles to his cattle] Come on! [cows emerge from the field and gather outside the front door.] Come on! Yeah, come on! Mr. Plant-based Burgers here is gonna take care of you now! [makes his way through the herd in order to leave] Yeah, don\\'t worry. He cares about the environment, so he could figure out what to do with you.\\nRandy\\nUh ho, hehey, fuck you!\\nRancher\\nNo, fuck you, sumbitch! They\\'re your problem now!\\nSouth Park Elementary, 4th Grade. The students are in their seats, but Mrs. Nelson is seated, hunched over a Tegridy Burger, unable to take another bite but making an effort to.\\nButters\\n...Teacher? [she lifts up a finger and mumbles a bit. The lunch bell rings]\\nCartman\\nLunchtime! [nothing was taught this morning]\\nThe school cafeteria, lunch. The students stream in as Mr. Mackey keeps watch\\nMr. Mackey\\nWalk, don\\'t run, m\\'kay?\\nCartman\\nHey Butters! [Butters stops, a bit unnerved] Wait up, dude. You know what today is, right? It\\'s Salisbury Steak day! Salisbury Steak day!\\nBoth\\nIt\\'s Salis-\\nButters\\n[flatly] -bury Steak day! [looks dejected]\\nCartman\\nButters, is something going on? Your lunch dances aren\\'t the same.\\nButters\\nEric, I. I just hate lying to you. I mean, you\\'ve been in the hospital. Twice. I feel guilty.\\nCartman\\nGuilty... about what?\\nButters\\nIt\\'s our lunches, Eric. It\\'s... Incredible Meat.\\nCartman\\nYes, I think it\\'s pretty good.\\nButters\\nNo, Eric. See, there was this guy. He\\'s a goo man.\\nCartman\\nThe fuck is a goo man?\\nTegridy Farms, day. The cows are still milling around eating the weed. Some of them poop as they walk. Randy is in his tractor driving around.\\nRandy\\n[comes across a cow] Go on! shoo! Hey! Goddamnit! [some time later, he\\'s talking to Towelie] I don\\'t know what we\\'re gonna do. These cows are eating all our weed and they\\'re shitting everywhere. They\\'re gonna put us completely out of business!\\nTowelie\\nDid you find anyone else to take \\'em?\\nRandy\\nNobody wants cows anymore! They\\'re bad for climate change! [takes a quick look around] We gotta kill \\'em.\\nTowelie\\nWhat?!\\nRandy\\nThey\\'re ruining our burger business! We gotta kill all these cows!\\nTowelie\\nHow are we gonna do that?\\nRandy\\nLook, it\\'s not gonna be easy. It\\'s not something anyone wants to do but... we\\'re just gonna have to get really, really high.\\nTegridy Farms, sunset. Randy and Towelie cook some Tegridy burgers on a grill in the barn and then eat them, becoming high. , to the tune of \"Pass The Dutchie\" by Musical Youth. At nightfall, they approach the cattle with shotguns and begin shooting them each directly in the head.\\nRandy\\nYeeheeyeah! [From a distance, silhouetted in the night, Randy and Towelie continue to shoot the cattle in the head. They then constume more tegridy burgers, surrounded by wrappers all across the ground. Randy is then seen using a bat to savagely beat one of the cows to the ground.]\\nTowelie\\nYeee-haw! [Rides a cow while holding a pistol, then shoots it in the head as both the cow and Towelie fall to the ground.]\\nBurger King, night. The room is dimly lit. The Goo Man is sitting at a booth speaking to someone, with a lantern on the desk next to him.\\nGoo Man\\nI\\'ve been in your town a little while now. What I see is a community that is ready for change. You see, I am a goo man. [across from him are Cartman and Butters. Butters looks between Cartman and the Goo Man nervously, pounding his fists.] What I serve in your school cafeteria is a synthetically-modulated plant protein. I have taken over nearly all the fast food restaurants here in town and teamed up with the fine people in your community. [The clerk is now standing next to him.] This my new regional manager, H.W.\\nClerk\\nIt\\'s Rick.\\nGoo Man\\n[annoyed.] Shut up, H.W. [narrows his eyes again.] You see, I\\'m trying to reach all the school cafeterias, all the stadiums, fast food restaurants, all the places that serve shitty food and serve shitty goo. [We see the Incredible Meats factory where his goo is made.] The goo for these kind of places is made in a factory. [A scientist is seen working in a laboratory, wearing a hair net and a mask, surrounded by microscopes, beakers and more.] It\\'s made in a lab. [Factory workers mi together the goo in enormous vats.x] It\\'s just down-market goo. [A worker pulls a level and green go comes down a slide out of a machine. The green go then goes down huge conveyor belts.] But I can tell people it\\'s healthy and earth friendly, [Construction workers build a long pipe in the mountains, lowering the last piece into place.] and I can send my goo through a network of pipes running all the way to the ocean. [Back to the Burger King as he finishes his monologue.] So, that it can be eaten by people who eat crappy food anyway -- from coast to coast.\\nCartman\\n[looking at Butters.] And that\\'s what we have for school lunch now? That\\'s what all the kids decided while I wasn\\'t there?\\nGoo Man\\nBut you see, it doesn\\'t work unless I own all the crappy food places. Mr. Rancher? [the Rancher walks in from the left side of the frame.]\\nRancher\\nY-Yes sir. Mr. Goo Man?\\nGoo Man\\nHave you done what I\\'ve asked you to do?\\nRancher\\nIt\\'s all done, sir. You\\'ll have everything you need.\\nGoo Man\\n[tips his hat.] Well if you don\\'t mind boys, I have work to tend to.\\nCartman\\nMe too. I need to have a word with the students at my school. [gets up to leave.]\\nButters\\n[concerned, following him away.] Oh, God, Eric! What are you gonna do?!\\nA news show\\nNews Anchor\\nIt has become the most popular burger in Colorado. The plant-based Tegridy Burger is changing the way people think about food. [Main Street. Twelve townspeople are eating Tegridy Burger and appear lethargic, with one man laying on the ground. A car moves slowly across the street, the occupant stopping then eating again twice.] All over the state, people are turning vegan and eating more ethical sustainable meat.\\nBll Keegan\\n[standing next to Randy in front of the crowded Tegridy Burger store, dozens of customers present.] I\\'m standing now with Randy Marsh, the owner of Tegridy Burger, and, Mr. Marsh, you must be pretty excited. [customers cheer and applaud Randy as he looks back at them.]\\nRandy\\nYeah, you know, we\\'re all just -- We\\'re all just bein\\' healthy and ethical over here!\\nBll Keegan\\nUh-huh, and, Mr. Marsh, what about [abruptly shifts tone, staring into camera and moving in front of Randy.] the student protests coming out against your burger right now?!\\nRandy\\n[caught by surprise.] Huh?\\nBll Keegan\\nStudents are coming forward, saying that Tegridy Farms is unethical and hypocritical.\\nRick\\n[joins the reporter, wearing a blond ewig and a blue college Cows jacket.] That\\'s right! Tegridy Burger is a fraud! We caught their farm on camera. Just take a look!\\nBll Keegan\\nWe warn you, the following footage is graphic. [footage plays of Randy and Towelie killing cattle the other night; Randy kicking a cow that is already dead as it groans; and Randy pulling down his pants and exposing himself next to a cow.]\\nRandy\\nHuhuhuh! [shooting a final cow in the footage as mooing can be heard]\\nBll Keegan\\nMr. Marsh, what do you have to say about these images? [customers are already booing and beginning to throw burgers at him.]\\nRandy\\nOh, hey. Fuck you! Oh, they were -- They were just -- We didn\\'t eat \\'em!\\nThe school cafeteria, lunchtime. The students are all enjoying lunch in the cafeteria when Cartman walks through the double doors, still in his hospital gown..\\nCartman\\nHey, guys, looks like I almost missed lunch.\\nButters\\n[Sitting with Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Craig, Clyde and Scott] Oh, God. Someone\\'s gonna die.\\nCartman\\nI found out about what we\\'re eating here at the school. I found out what it\\'s made of and where!\\nMr. Mackey\\n[Approaching Cartman cautiously] N-Now, Eric, stay calm, mm-kay! We\\'re sorry. We were just trying to find a compromise! Now just be calm.\\nCartman\\nWhat are you sorry about? It\\'s me who owes all you guys an apology. [The students all look deeply confused.] I thought you guys were all trying to force me to eat healthy, but I\\'ve learned that a lot of this stuff is made in a factory and processed with tons of salt just like all my favorite foods! SpaghettiOs, Rice-A-Roni... Here I was thinking what you wanted was stuff from a farmers market. I just didn\\'t want my food to change. School cafeteria meat is just processed crap that comes in a box, and this is... just processed crap that comes in a box. [Wendy, Bebe and Monica Ryland seem dismayed as they look at their food now.] I don\\'t have a problem with it. All I wanted was to be able to eat the same garbage I always have, and this is definitely garbage. And hey, if it happens to be more ethical and sustainable, well, I guess I\\'m fine with that, too. So, you see, guys? There was actually no reason to protest! We were actually all on the same page all the time! At least we learned that freedom of speech truly doesn\\'t matter! Come on, let\\'s eat!

I got my very first paycheck!\\nCartman\\nThat\\'s not fair! I want a paycheck!\\nButters\\nMy dad told me if I got a job, we could put my paychecks in my very own bank account.\\nCartman\\nI want a bank account!\\nStan\\nI didn\\'t know kids could get jobs.\\nButters\\nYeah, well, I guess these days it\\'s really hard for businesses to find people to work, so they\\'ll take whatever they can get.\\nCartman\\nI want to take whatever I can get!\\nButters\\nIt\\'s what they call the Great Resignation Labor Shortage. So now, if you have your parents\\' permission, there are some jobs they\\'ll even let kids do.\\nCartman\\nThat is messed up! Why does he get to have a job? I want a job!\\nKyle\\nYou wouldn\\'t last 4 hours on a job, fatass.\\nCartman\\nExcuse me? That\\'s easy for you to say! You don\\'t need a job, \\'cause you live in a nice house! I have to live in a shithole like Kenny does! It\\'s not fair that some people in our country are given the opportunity for employment, while others aren\\'t!\\nCartman starts to leave.\\nCartman\\nI\\'m gonna tell my mom!\\nCartman leaves.\\nScene cuts to Cartman\\'s house, where Liane is on the couch watching TV and knitting. Cartman enters.\\nCartman\\nMom! Mom! I need your permission to get a job.\\nLiane\\nOh, you\\'re too young to have a job, sweetie!\\nCartman\\nButters got a job!\\nLiane ignores Cartman\\nCartman\\nMom! Look at this shithole we live in! Somebody has to get a job, \\'cause you just sit on your ass all day!\\nLiane\\nI had a job, Eric, but you got me fired because you wanted me taking care of you, and that\\'s why we had to sell our house!\\nCartman\\nYes! Right! Because I\\'m the man of the house. You\\'re supposed to take care of me, and I\\'m supposed to go get a job. You really expect us to live like this the rest of our lives? This is not a proper place to raise a child! You have to go let me find a job, Mom!\\nLiane\\nEric, the truth is, I don\\'t think you\\'d last 4 hours at a job.\\nCartman\\nOh! Now you sound like Kyle! Do you run Hollywood with him? Are you a Jew too, Mom?\\nLiane\\nAlright, Eric, fine! You want to go get a job and have a little dose of reality? Maybe it\\'ll be good for you.\\nCartman\\nThanks, Mom! I love you!\\nCartman leaves.\\nScene cuts to the ice cream store where Butters is working.\\nButters\\nLoo, loo, loo, I\\'m serving ice cream. Loo, loo, loo, you\\'ll eat it too. Loo, loo, loo, I\\'m serving ice cream...\\nButters goes to the checkout counter and hands ice cream to a customer.\\nButters\\nOkay, and the pistachio maple cream. Let me know if you need extra napkins for your table, and have a creamy day!\\nCartman enters the store.\\nButters\\nOh, hey, Eric!\\nCartman\\nHey, Butters! I\\'m here for my job.\\nButters\\nWhat are you talking about?\\nCartman\\nMy mom gave me permission; I can start work now. What do I do?\\nButters\\nWell, but, Eric, this is my job.\\nCartman\\nYeah, I want your job, sitting around eating ice cream. Sounds fun.\\nButters\\nEric, there\\'s a lot more to it than that, and I already do this job, so...\\nManager\\nEverything alright, Butters?\\nButters\\nOh. Yes, Mr. Sullivan. I was just...\\nCartman\\nHello, sir. I\\'m a dear friend of Butters. He told me all about this place and said I should get permission from my mom to work here.\\nManager\\nOh. Well, uh, I do need all the help I can get. Butters, can you vouch for him? Is he trustworthy and reliable?\\nButters\\nUh, oh, uh...\\nCartman glares at Butters.\\nButters\\nUm, okay.\\nManager\\nAlright, well, let\\'s find him a uniform, and you can start training him.\\nCartman\\nHey, man! I got a job!\\nTitle card: \"1:43 PM\", \"13 MINUTES INTO JOB\"\\nButters\\nAlright, Eric. So there\\'s three types of ice cream: waffle cone, sugar cone, and cups.\\nCartman\\nUh-huh, and when do we get to have breaks?\\nButters\\nWell, you get a ten-minute break every two hours, but only after you check all the freezers, which are right over there, and need to always be set to 0°.\\nCartman\\nOkay, and how much longer do we have to be here?\\nButters\\nEric, please, I don\\'t want to lose this job...\\nA customer walks in.\\nButters\\nOh. Hello, sir. Hope you\\'re having a creamy day. What can I get for you?\\nCustomer\\nCan I have a single scoop of coconut almond fudge?\\nButters\\nOkay. Eric, can you scoop out some coconut almond fudge?\\nCartman\\nWhy?\\nButters\\nBecause it\\'s your job, Eric.\\nCartman\\nWhoa, Butters. Let\\'s not make this a toxic work environment, okay?\\nButters\\nOne second, sir. I\\'ll get that scoop.\\nTitle card: \"2:07 PM\", \"37 MINUTES INTO JOB\"\\nCartman\\n[on the phone] Yeah, I got a job in an ice cream shop. Yeah, it\\'s dumb as hell, but I\\'m going to start getting paychecks.\\nManager\\nButters, what is this about?\\nButters\\nOh, sorry, sir. Eric?\\nCartman\\nYeah, I know. She\\'s pretty hot, but she\\'s got droopy boobs.\\nButters\\nEric! Eric, you can\\'t just sit there at a table.\\nCartman\\n[to Butters] Yeah, I can. It\\'s Monday.\\nButters\\nSo?\\nCartman\\nSo haven\\'t you heard of Bare Minimum Mondays? It\\'s a thing that young people created because we care about our mental health.\\nButters\\nI don\\'t care if it\\'s Bare Minimum Monday! Eric, you need to...\\nCartman\\'s phone beeps.\\nCartman\\nOh, break time. I\\'ll be back.\\nTitle card: \"3:15 PM\", \"1.2 HOURS INTO JOB\"\\nThe line of customers is out the door. Butters is visibly stressed from working.\\nManager\\nButters! Butters, we got a line out the door. People are getting upset.\\nButters\\nI know, sir. I\\'m sorry.\\nManager\\nWell, where is your friend?\\nButters\\nHe hasn\\'t come back from his break yet.\\nChild\\nButters Stotch?\\nButters\\nYes?\\nChild\\nDelivery for you.\\nThe child hands Butters a laptop with a note that says \"OPEN ME\".\\nButters opens the laptop, to reveal Cartman on video call.\\nCartman\\nHey, Butters!\\nButters\\nAh! Eric, where are you?\\nCartman\\nI wasn\\'t feeling the best so I decided to work from home.\\nManager\\nButters, what\\'s going on?\\nButters\\nUh, Eric says he\\'s going to work from home.\\nManager\\nHow can he work from home? This is an ice cream shop!\\nCartman\\nYeah, no, \\'cause see, I\\'m actually taking a mental health day. Yeah, young people can just ask for a mental health day and employers can\\'t deny them. It\\'s my mental health day.\\nButters\\nEric, you need to come here right now or we\\'re both gonna get fired!\\nCartman\\nOkay, I guess so. But don\\'t forget that tomorrow is Take-it-Easy Tuesday.\\nTitle card: \"4:32 PM\", \"3 HOURS AND 2 MINUTES INTO JOB...\"\\nButters\\nOkay, thanks for coming, and have a creamy day.\\nButters\\nHi, hope you\\'re having a creamy day. Can I help you?\\nCartman\\nYou know what\\'s total bullcrap, Butters? It\\'s how much money the owner of this place is making while we\\'re out here busting our asses. I mean, what does that old fart even do?\\nButters\\nEric, could you please fill this nice lady\\'s order?\\nCartman\\nOh, yes, let me get that for you, master, right away now.\\nCartman\\nI mean, seriously, Butters, why do we have to work for the owner? We know how to do all this stuff now. We don\\'t even need that guy. There has to be a way we could turn the tables. There has to be a way we could make all the money.\\n\"Also sprach Zarathustra\" by Richard Strauss starts playing.\\nCartman\\nWait a minute...\\nCartman pulls a hot dog out of the water, and imagines the hot dog stand where he lives. His mind then explodes.\\nCartman\\nButters! Butters! That\\'s it!\\nCartman leaves.\\nButters\\nEric!\\nScene cuts to Kenny\\'s house. Kenny is on the couch playing video games.\\nCartman barges in.\\nCartman\\nKenny!\\nKenny\\n(Jesus Christ, dude!)\\nCartman\\nKenny! Kenny, you\\'re not going to believe this, but I just quit my job.\\nKenny\\n(You had a job?)\\nCartman\\nYes, I had a job. But I got fed up, sick of working my fingers to the bone for some piece-of-shit owner. And that\\'s when it hit me. Kenny, we should open a restaurant.\\nKenny\\n(Why the fuck would we open a restaurant?)\\nCartman\\nYou know the hot dog I\\'ve been living in? It\\'s an old, like, historic landmark. It\\'s been sitting right in front of us completely ready to go! All it would take is some minor renovations and some care. We can make it awesome with, like, fun things for kids to do, and rides and games. A place that people from all over Colorado would want to come and see! And we would be the owners. And we could have all the hot dogs we wanted.\\nKenny\\n(Whoa.)\\nCartman\\nAren\\'t you sick of living like this, Kenny? All we need is an investor, and we can make our dreams come true. And I know somebody who has a bank account and gets paychecks every week.\\nScene cuts to the bank. Cartman, Kenny, Butters, and a banker are meeting.\\nButters\\nNo. No, no, no. Thank you, no.\\nCartman\\nButters, don\\'t you want to invest your money in something that matters? That\\'s why we came to your bank to offer you this awesome deal.\\nBanker\\nWhat we can do, Eric, is set up a line of credit for an LLC which then pays you back not only your investment, but also principal in the company.\\nButters\\nBut I like my ice cream job. I don\\'t want to open a hot dog.\\nCartman\\nNo, you keep working at the ice cream shop. We\\'re going to open the hot dog. All you do is collect the money as the investor.\\nButters\\nYeah, but this is my money. I worked hard for it.\\nCartman\\nButters, it\\'s just like... You\\'re lucky, you know? You have money. But look at Kenny. Can you imagine what it\\'s like for him watching rich white boys like you just collecting paycheck after paycheck, while he wallows in the filth of his tiny house?\\nKenny\\n[offended] (The fuck?)\\nCartman\\nButters, Kenny deserves a chance to be able to work like you do. Please, give him that chance.\\nButters\\nUh, I just give a bit of my paycheck every week to you guys?\\nCartman\\nAnd we pay you back as soon as we make our first dollar, Butters. You have my word on it.\\nButters\\nOh, okay.\\nCartman\\nYeah!\\nKenny\\n(Yeah!)\\nCartman\\nGuys, we\\'re going into the restaurant business.\\nMontage of Cartman and Kenny renovating the restaurant, and Butters working at the ice cream shop. \"Workin\\' for a Livin\\'\" by Huey Lewis and the News plays.\\nCartman\\nThis is going to be the best restaurant in Colorado, Kenny. And I know exactly what we should name it.\\nScene cuts to news reporter standing outside of restaurant.\\nReporter\\nTom, I\\'m standing out front of a Colorado icon: the old Coney Island Hot Dog, where the owners plan to reopen soon. The hot dog stand is going through major renovations and the new name has just been announced: DikinBaus Hot Dogs is sure to be a big hit here in town.\\nScene cuts to Cartman and Kenny watching TV in Kenny\\'s house\\nCartman\\n[laughs] He said it! We got him to say DikinBaus!\\nKenny\\n[laughs]\\nReporter\\nThe owners say they\\'re planning on all kinds of rides and games. And also, with each hot dog served here at DikinBaus Hot Dogs, they actually use the ketchup to put a nice little smiley face on the plate.\\nCartman\\n[laughs]\\nKenny\\n[laughs]\\nReporter\\nIt\\'s just their sort of trademark touch. The renovations are supposed to be finished soon and the new owners are inviting everyone to come on down, enjoy, and let DikinBaus put a smile on your buns.\\nCartman\\n[laughs]\\nKenny\\n[laughs]\\nCartman\\nLet DikinBaus put a smile on your buns! [laughs]\\nButters angrily enters Kenny\\'s house\\nCartman\\nOh. Hey, Butters. We have some of those first-quarter projections to show you. Do you have the first-quarter projections, Kenny?\\nKenny\\n(Uh, let me see. Where did we put those?)\\nButters\\nAre you guys just playing around?\\nCartman\\nNo, we are renovating and opening an amazing restaurant that will be extremely profitable.\\nButters\\nThen why did you name it DikinBaus?\\nCartman\\nButters, you are the investor. We are the creatives.\\nButters\\nWell, stop being creative and open the goddamn restaurant so I can get my money back! So stop dicking around and wasting my money.\\nCartman\\nButters, at DikinBaus, dicking around is all we do, dicking around the competition.\\nButters leaves.\\nCartman\\n[laughs]\\nKenny\\n[laughs]\\nScene cuts to Liane doing dishes at home. A construction crane arrives with a giant mermaid sculpture.\\nLiane\\nWhat on Earth?\\nLiane goes outside.\\nCartman\\nOkay, that\\'s good! Mermaid goes to the mermaid grotto right over there.\\nLiane\\nEric! Eric, I think you\\'ve done enough renovations.\\nCartman\\nMom, no offense, but will you shut your mouth because you know nothing about the restaurant business?\\nConstruction worker\\nExcuse me, are you guys the owners?\\nCartman\\nYes, we\\'re the owners.\\nConstruction worker\\nWell, we got your zip line put in, but this asphalt is so old it\\'s not going to hold the eye bolts.\\nCartman\\nSo, what does that mean?\\nConstruction worker\\nI think you\\'ve got to re-asphalt the entire parking area or just lose the zip line.\\nCartman\\nWell, obviously, we\\'re not going to lose the zip line, so let\\'s see what we can do.\\nConstruction worker\\nAlright. Well then, over here on your mermaid grotto, the mermaid is in but she can\\'t actually spit water because there\\'s no plumbing underneath.\\nCartman\\nJesus Christ. Well, I guess we got to find a way to add plumbing.\\nCartman\\nAlright, everyone, it\\'s looking good, but we have aways to go. I don\\'t know about you, but I am exhausted. I think we should all just take the rest of the day off because it\\'s Wet\\'s-Not-Work-Too-Hard Wednesday.\\nConstruction workers leave\\nButters arrives home from work.\\nStephen\\nBack from work, Butters?\\nButters\\nOh. Hey, Mom and Dad.\\nStephen\\nYou must be so tired from selling all that ice cream.\\nButters\\nWell, yeah. It was a pretty long night.\\nStephen\\nA long night, he says. That\\'s great, Butters. Only problem is, if you\\'re really working at a job, then why is there $0 in your bank account?\\nButters\\nWhat?\\nStephen\\nSo now what are you really doing, young man?\\nButters\\n$0? But I\\'ve been working every day!\\nStephen\\nOh, sure. I know exactly how it is. You say you have to work so you can get out of the house, get away from the family, and you go down to that glory hole down on Fourth and Larimer.\\nLinda\\nOh my God! Butters!\\nStephen\\nAnd while your family thinks you\\'re at your job, you\\'re actually strapped face down on a bed at the Brighton Motel, taking any load you can find on Adultfriendfinder.\\nLinda\\n[cries]\\nStephen\\nIt\\'s the lies! It\\'s the lies! I can\\'t take anymore. I\\'m going to go to the office and get some work done.\\nStephen leaves.\\nLinda\\n[cries]\\nButters\\n[infuriated] That son of a gun!\\nScene cuts to DikinBaus.

What the hell do you think you\\'re doing? You can just take my money out of my gosh dang bank account without my permission...\\nCartman\\nButters. Butters! Would you relax?\\nButters\\nWhere\\'s all the money gone from my bank account?\\nCartman\\nYou said to get things moving. We needed the funds to go faster.\\nButters\\nYou said you\\'d never access my account without my permission!\\nCartman\\nButters, we\\'re about to reopen a historic landmark that means something to people. You think I\\'m just doing all this for the fun of it? Hang on a second.\\nCartman goes down the slide.\\nCartman\\nWe\\'re creating jobs, Butters! And we\\'re helping people.\\nButters\\nThen open the stupid place, Eric!\\nCartman\\nFine! We\\'ll start hiring tomorrow morning and we\\'ll be open by the afternoon. And trust me, Butters, when we open and you see how successful it is, you\\'re going to apologize to me.\\nScene cuts to following morning. Cartman and Kenny have a table set up in front of the restaurant for people to interview, but no one is there.\\nCartman\\nWhat the hell is going on? Why is nobody showing up?\\nKenny\\n(I don\\'t know, dude.)\\nA teenager passes by on a scooter.\\nCartman\\nHey! Hey! Excuse me! You want to come work at DikinBaus for minimum wage?\\nTeenager\\nNo.\\nTeenager leaves.\\nCartman\\nThat\\'s \\'cause your generation is lazy! You got all comfy during the pandemic! Nobody knows how to work anymore!\\nDarryl Weathers shows up in his truck.\\nDarryl\\nThey\\'re saying you people here might have a job?\\nCartman\\nYes! Please, have a seat.\\nDarryl sits down.\\nCartman\\nUm, so, what kind of experience do you have?\\nDarryl\\nWell, I was working down at the Budd factory in Fort Collins, but then Joe Biden caused a recession, so they took my job!\\nKenny\\n(Whoa!)\\nDarryl\\nThen I worked over at Waffle House, but they decided they needed employees to be more \"inclusive\", so they took my job!\\nKenny\\n(Sorry to hear that.)\\nDarryl\\nAnd then I got let go from the bowling alley, and all I want is a damn job!\\nCartman\\nWell, I believe that we here at DikinBaus would like to hire you immediately.\\nDarryl\\nOkay. Can I work from home?\\nKenny\\n(What?)\\nCartman\\nNo, you can\\'t work from home. It\\'s a hot dog stand!\\nDarryl\\nWell, I could work here, but I\\'ll need mental health days off to deal with the toxic environment.\\nCartman\\nWhere do people get this stuff? Alright, fine. Never mind, we don\\'t want to hire you.\\nDarryl\\nYou\\'re gonna take my job? They took my job!\\nDarryl leaves.\\nScene cuts to following morning.\\nCartman\\nGood morning, everyone. After an exhaustive search for employees, we have determined that you are the best of the best.\\nScene cuts to reveal Clyde, Scott Malkinson, and a toddler.\\nCartman\\nYes. We\\'re sure you\\'re excited to be part of the DikinBaus team. And we are certainly glad to have you here.\\nScott\\nWe\\'re happy to be here.\\nCartman\\nShut up, Scott. Now listen, it\\'s going to take dedication and drive to get this place open. Isn\\'t that right, Kenny?\\nCartman turns around laptop to reveal Kenny on video call.\\nCartman\\nSorry, Kenny\\'s working from home today \\'cause it\\'s his mental health day.\\nKenny\\n(Hey, guys.)\\nToddler\\nHi.\\nCartman\\nNow, there may not be many of us. But in order to open, we\\'re going to have to...\\nClyde\\nDo I get mental health days, too?\\nCartman\\nOh, here we go. Fine, Clyde, what days do you need to have mental health days?\\nClyde\\nWell, how should I know until I\\'m feeling mentally unhealthy?\\nCartman\\nGoddammit, you guys! It isn\\'t going to work like this, okay?\\nScott\\nUm, I\\'m also going to need five-minute breaks every hour to check my insulin levels.\\nCartman\\nYou\\'re fucking joking! This is a goddamn restaurant, you guys! There\\'s no time for diabetes! You don\\'t here Mrs. Anderson complaining about her time off!\\nToddler\\nI don\\'t work on No-Thinky Thursdays.\\nCartman\\nOh, that\\'s it! That\\'s it! I give up! It\\'s impossible to open any kind of business these days when this generation doesn\\'t know how to work!\\nButters arrives.\\nButters\\nHey, fellas.\\nCartman\\nOh, great! Now the bank is here. Scrooge McButters to collect on his money.\\nButters\\nYou haven\\'t made any money.\\nCartman\\nButters, the truth is, we tried. The fact of the matter is, the U.S. government failed this generation by shutting down businesses in the pandemic, and now they don\\'t know how to go back. I\\'m sorry, but we lost all your money. But there is a good side to this because, as you can see, I now have a house that has slides, and games, and a mermaid grotto. And you can come and hang out all you want.\\nButters\\n[infuriated] Gosh dang it!\\nButters goes to start cooking and serving hot dogs. Begin montage\\nButters\\nAttention, everyone!

You\\'re a hero.\\nCartman\\nOh my God! Oh my God! This is a dream come true!\\nEnd montage. Scene cuts to South Park Bank. Butters is meeting with a banker.\\nBanker\\nWell, congratulations, young man. DikinBaus Hot Dogs is a big success, and here\\'s your first return on your investment. I\\'m sure there\\'s many more to come.\\nButters\\nOh, I made my money back, huh?\\nBanker\\nNow what I\\'m thinking, Butters, is that we should grow your business by applying for a corporate loan, which could pay you dividends as you expand the company into new areas.\\nButters\\nYeah, I wasn\\'t thinking that. See, all I ever wanted was just to do my job, learn how to work, and help Mr. Sullivan sell ice cream. So I\\'m thinking I\\'m actually going to conduct a market analysis to look for potential buyers and roll over the company as an exit strategy.\\nBanker\\nWell, you could do that, but I think you\\'d have trouble getting investors who will commit major capital for just partial ownership.\\nButters\\nYeah, so that\\'s why I want to approach overseas investors who will buy the IP, the restaurant operations, and the real estate outright.\\nBanker\\nBut you couldn\\'t do that because there\\'s already tenants in the building who have to be relocated.\\nButters\\nYeah, I thought of that too. Come on in.\\nLiane enters\\nLiane\\nHello.\\nBanker\\nWait, so you two have already discussed some kind of deal?\\nLiane\\nOh, yes. Butters and I have been talking, and we think that my little Eric deserves to get exactly what he\\'s been wanting for a long time.\\nScene cuts to DikinBaus. Liane drags Cartman out the front door.\\nCartman\\nNo! No, what are you doing? DikinBaus is mine! You can\\'t sell DikinBaus!\\nScene cuts to the Cartmans\\' old house, which they are moving back into\\nCartman\\nNo! Take me back! No! Please!\\nMover\\nThis picture go over here, Mrs. Cartman?\\nLiane\\nOh, yes. That\\'s perfect. Thank you.\\nCartman\\nWhat is this?\\nLiane\\nThe new owners paid for us to have our old house back.\\nCartman\\nI don\\'t want my old house! I want DikinBaus!\\nLiane\\nCome on.\\nCartman\\nNo! No!\\nLiane\\nThere you go, Eric. It\\'s your old room just like you always wanted.\\nCartman\\nBut I hate this stupid house! I don\\'t want to be here! I want to be in DikinBaus! DikinBaus is awesome! This place sucks! Please! I want DikinBaus! I want my DikinBaus! DikinBaus! DikinBaus!\\n'"

The family exits and goes to the car. Stan\\'s right arm is in a cast and sling from last week\\'s gunshot at the end of the episode.\\nRandy\\nCome on, guys, we don\\'t wanna be late!\\nStan\\n[trailing behind] Do I have to go? It\\'s the only day I get to play games.\\nRandy\\nWe\\'re all going. Come on! [the others get in]\\nOn the road. Stan sits behind Randy, Shelley sits behind Sharon\\nStan\\n[upset] ...Don\\'t understand why we have to go to church every Sunday.\\nRandy\\nChurch is important, Stan. Way more important than video games and TV. Church is about community and coming together. A lot of things.\\nSharon\\nAll I know is that after church I feel better.\\nRandy\\nYeah. Me too.\\nThe church, day. There\\'s a parking lot across from the Church, and the townsfolk park there for Sunday Mass. There\\'s a crosswalk leading to the Church across the street. The Marshes pull in and say hello to the others\\nRandy\\nHey, mornin\\' Stephen, Linda.\\nStephen\\n[chuckling] Morning, guys.\\nAfter crossing the street, Randy plays doorman to the other congregants\\nTownsman\\nAww thanks there, Randy.\\nRandy\\nYou got it- hey, where\\'s Josie?\\nTownsman\\nOh, she slipped her disc in her neck. Poor thing can barely move.\\nRandy\\nAw, she\\'s gonna miss church? That\\'s too bad. Give her my best. [other congregants move past him as he talks]\\nThe church, interior. The congregants are in. Father Maxi finishes reading from the Gospel of John, chapter 3\\nFr. Maxi\\nFor God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, [adjusts his glasses over his left eye] so that whoever believed in him should have eternal life. This is the Gospel of the Lord.\\nCongregants\\nPraise to you, Lord Jesus Christ. [all sit]\\nFr. Maxi\\n[begins his sermon] Today\\'s gospel talks about what the Lord has to give us. He did so because we could not control our temptations.\\nRandy\\nKind of like a priest in a room full of naked boys. [snorts and other people start laughing]\\nFr. Maxi\\nUh Okay, okay, let\\'s, let\\'s try and have none of that today. In John 3:16, the Gospel tells us how God so loved the world he gave to us his only Son\\nStephen\\nAnd a Catholic priest raped him. [all laugh]\\nFr. Maxi\\nOkay, okay, Co-come on guys, Nu-now, what greater gift could the Lord has given to us?\\nWoman\\nChildren\\'s underwear which priests couldn\\'t pull down so easily? [all laugh]\\nFr. Maxi\\nOkay, let\\'s, let\\'s try to compose ourselves. Let\\'s try and just get through this first one, okay guys? What does it mean that the Lord gave us his only begotten Son?\\nTownsman 1\\nIt means that if you\\'re a cute boy at a Catholic priest\\'s swimming party you\\'d better be gettin\\'! [The congregants laugh. Randy gets carried and falls on the aisle laughing and pounding his fists on the floor.]\\nThe Church. Mass ends and the congregant\\'s exit.\\nRandy\\nOh, that was a great one, Nelson. Salvation in a little boy\\'s mouth. I\\'m gonna post that one for sure.\\nWoman 2\\nWho said the thing about naked boy salad?\\nStephen\\nOh that was Linda!\\nJimbo\\nWell, see ya next week, everybody! [waves and moves off to his left]\\nOthers\\nYeah, see ya! See ya! Bye.\\nThe Marsh car, on the way home\\nStan\\nI really don\\'t understand the point of all that.\\nRandy\\n[chuckles] Yeah, well, I used to think that about church when I was a kid too.\\nStan\\nBut back then I don\\'t know if church was that stupid.\\nRandy\\nHey, don\\'t say things like that, Stan! You wanna go to fuckin\\' Hell?\\nThe Church, sometime later. Father Maxi is blowing out the candles, looking sad. Butters enters quietly through the back. Maxi walks to the front pew and sits down, then sighs. Butters walks up to him\\nButters\\nFather, can I talk to you?\\nFr. Maxi\\nOh, of course, my child. What\\'s troubling you?\\nButters\\nWell, what\\'s troubling you? [sits down next to Maxi] You know, at school the kids used to all make fun of me sometimes. One kid would say something mean, a-and then the other kids would laugh. I know how lousy it feels. I learned to just walk away, not give \\'em all the satisfaction.\\nFr. Maxi\\nWell, we can\\'t all walk away. The-the priesthood is all I know. I, I dedicated my entire life to it. Ah I don\\'t know anything else.\\nButters\\nI know it seems impossible. I thought I\\'d be a punching bag my whole life, but now, I\\'m one of the popular kids. I even get invited to board game night at Stan\\'s house. My point is, sometimes, y-you just gotta put yourself out there.\\nThe Marsh house, night. The four boys are seated at a table eating pepperoni pizza and drinking sodas. They\\'re playing a board game called Western Legends. Cartman is wearing a straw hat for the occasion. There\\'s the fifth card and chair waiting for someone to fill it\\nCartman\\nI wanna be Calamity Jane this time.\\nStan\\nHow many cards do you start with, Kenny?\\nKenny\\n(Two cards.) [the front door opens and the boys turn to see who it is]\\nKyle\\nOh, there\\'s Butters!\\nButters\\n[walks in] Oh hey, fellas. I hope you don\\'t mind I brought a friend. Come on in. [steps aside for his friend to appear - it\\'s Fr. Maxi]\\nFr. Maxi\\nUh, hello, my children. [walks in. The boys just stare at him. Moments later he\\'s seated with them, between Stan and Cartman, and Butters sits next to Kyle.]\\nStan\\nOkay, so I-I guess I\\'m gonna go to the saloon and try to arrest Cartman.\\nCartman\\nLet\\'s see what you got, bitch.\\nButters\\nSo, Kyle, did you know Father is a really good singer? You like to sing too, don\\'t you?\\nKyle\\nNo.\\nFr. Maxi\\nPraise the Lord, for the Lord is good. Sing praise to his name, for that is pleasant.\\nCartman\\nAce. You lose. [Stan\\'s jaw drops]\\nRandy\\n[coming down from the second floor] Hey Stan, [Stan sits up] have you seen my- [sees Fr. Maxi at the table, has a stunned look, then smiles] No way! [searches his pockets for his phone] Hang on! Hang on! I gotta post this!\\nFr. Maxi\\n[quickly gets up to leave] Uh, I shouldn\\'t be here.\\nRandy\\nThis is hilarious! [takes some pics] Four boys and a priest playing a board game!\\nButters\\nAw, Father, wait a-\\nFr. Maxi\\nI should go.\\nRandy\\nNononoait, let me get the picture. [Maxi goes out the front door and disappears]\\nButters\\nFather! [follows Maxi out and closes the door]\\nRandy\\nAw shit, I missed it!\\nCartman\\nUgh. [looks at Stan] Why did you invite Butters to game night?\\nStan\\nI didn\\'t invite him. [Cartman looks at Kenny, who just looks back]\\nOn the sidewalk. Maxi looks dejected as he walks away. Butters catches up\\nButters\\nCome on, Father, you can\\'t give up so fast.\\nFr. Maxi\\nThis is just gonna make things way worse. People will rip on me.\\nButters\\nWho cares? Who cares what people say?\\nFr. Maxi\\nI do.\\nButters\\nAw, come on, you gotta be strong!\\nFr. Maxi\\n[turns around] Why do you care?!\\nButters\\nBecause I was you. Okay? I wasn\\'t always this cool. I\\'ve been through it. But then one day, somebody told me something. He said \"life is full of love and light and bountiful things,\" and you know who told me that? You did! Two years ago, in church! You have a right to go and be happy! And if people wanna keep tryin\\' to knock you down, well, fuck \\'em!\\nThe Church, the following Sunday. The congregants gather again. In the parking lot, The Marshes see Mr. Mackey\\nRandy\\nHey, mornin\\' Mackey!\\nMr. Mackey\\nWell Happy Sunday! Mornin\\' Ted, Hazel.\\nTed\\nMornin\\'.\\nHazel\\nMorning.\\nOthers\\nMorning. [all head to church]\\nRandy\\nAh, doin\\' better, huh, Josie?\\nJosie\\nA lot better. Thank you.\\nRandy\\nAll right. [now at the church doors, tries to open then, no avail] Huh. What the? [realizes that the doors are locked] It\\'s not open.\\nRyan\\nLet me try. [goes up and tries to open the doors]\\nRandy\\nHey! Hey, it\\'s nine o\\'clock! Hey!\\nWoman\\nWhat\\'s going on? [the doors unlock and open, and Butters steps out]\\nRandy\\n[points him out] Ohhh! [the others laugh]\\nButters\\nThere\\'s no church today! You all are just gonna have to find some\\'n\\' better to do! [slams the doors shut and locks them.]\\nRandy\\nHey... [tries to get them open again] Hey, open the door! Hey, come on! [pulls the doors harder and grunts]\\nThe car, on the way home. No Mass today, so that\\'s it.\\nRandy\\nWell this sucks. What are we supposed to do without church?\\nSharon\\nI just feel so empty.\\nShelley\\nWhat are you guys so upset about?\\nRandy\\nShut up, Shelley!\\nA clearing in the woods outside of town, night. Father Maxi and Butters are enjoying a small campfire, with marshmallows roasting on the open fire. They sit on two folding chairs\\nButters\\nIsn\\'t this great, Father? Fresh mountain air, a nice warm fire, a nice warm fire.\\nFr. Maxi\\nI have to admit it\\'s a pretty nice way to spend a Sunday. How many are your works, Lord? In wisdom you made them all.\\nButters\\nYeah, the Lord is pretty cool.\\nFr. Maxi\\nHe is. Because he brought me you.\\nA song comes on whose only verse is \"Faith In Christ.\" The montage that accompanies it starts with Maxi and Butters walking through the forest. Maxi points to a bird. Maxi and Butters row in a canoe. Butters and Maxi sit on a bench at Stark\\'s pond watching the sunset. They watch a family of ducks floats by. Maxi puts his right arm around Butters, Butters puts his left hand on Maxi\\'s lap. They go to the movies and enjoy some snacks. A couple to their left just stares at them. They\\'re in the park on some swings when the four boys stop by and look at them, then continue walking. They\\'re at the organ in church. Maxi plays some tunes for Butters. Maxi shows Butters some Bible verses on the computer. At the public library, Maxi holds Butters a little closer, Butters puts his left hand over his right shoulder and cups it over Maxi\\'s right hand. A man picks out from his computer nearby and looks at them. In his bedroom, Butters shows Maxi the fun he has in playing Professor Chaos. Back in the woods, at night, Maxi shows Butters a shooting star. Still in the woods, during the day, Butters points out a cloud formation that sort of resembles a dove.\\nThe cathedral in Denver, day. The archbishop sits at his desk writing something down. The phone rings. He answers it.\\nArchbishop\\nDenver archdiocese. The Lord be with you.\\nMr. Mackey\\n[outside the church in South Park] And with your spirit, m\\'kay? Uh, oh my name is Counselor Mackey, and w-uh we seem to be havin\\' a little problem with our local church here in South Park. Our uh... our priest has gone missing.\\nArchbishop\\n[mutes the phone and whispers] Oh, not another one! [unmutes the phone] All right, listen to me carefully. Your local priest has not done anything wrong. He\\'s probably just taking some time off. Why is that suspicious?\\nMr. Mackey\\nWell, it\\'s not suspicious, we just kind of don\\'t know what to do, you know? Uh.\\nArchbishop\\nWe\\'ll take care of it. There\\'s no need to involve the authorities. Just sit tight. [hangs up and switches to another line] Send in a clean-up crew now! [the doors quickly open and the clean-up crew appears.] We\\'ve got another one. A priest on South Park has gone rogue and is probably out doing his thing. I need you guys to get up there and clean up his mess.\\nAuxiliary\\nDon\\'t worry, Your Holiness. By the time we\\'re done with that town there won\\'t be a lick of cum anywhere.\\nKidZone Roller Rink, day. Happy birthday, Clyde. Kids and adults skate in the center of the building while others sit outside the rink eating. At the birthday gathering, Kyle approaches Clyde and talks to him. Butters appears. Throughout the scene, \"Flash Light\" plays\\nButters\\nHappy birthday, Clyde! [behind him is Fr. Maxi. They both have gifts for Clyde.] Hope you don\\'t mind I brought a friend.\\nFr. Maxi\\nFor we are God\\'s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works.\\nClyde\\nDude, what are you talking about?!\\nFr. Maxi\\nCome on, Father. Let\\'s go tear up the skating rink. [they drop their gifts off and head to the rink. Clyde is angered by Fr. Maxi\\'s presence, and Kyle notices.]\\nKyle\\nJust leave it alone, Clyde. Butters brings him everywhere.\\nClyde\\nI don\\'t care, I don\\'t want a priest at my fucking birthday party!\\nCartman\\n[turns to calm Clyde down] It\\'s all right, Clyde, it\\'s all right.\\nIn the rink, Butters tries to get Fr. Maxi to fit in.\\nButters\\nThat\\'s it! You\\'re doing great!\\nFr. Maxi\\nUh-ah. Oh, Mother Mary. I feel like everyone\\'s staring at me. [he\\'s not wrong...]\\nButters\\nNobody\\'s staring. I\\'m gonna get us some soda pop. You just mingle with the other fellas![skates off]\\nSkeeter\\'s wine bar, day. \"A Place To Fall Apart\" plays and the front doors are wide open. Randy and Stuart sit at the bar. Randy drinks some wine, Stuart some beer\\nRandy\\nWhat\\'s it all about, huh? Are we just bags of carbon and water put on this planet for no purpose? You\\'re born, you die, then you\\'re just... food for the worms.\\nStuart\\nIt all does seem pretty meaningless.\\nTownsman 2\\n[appears in the doorway] Hey, the church is back open! There are people inside!\\nJimbo\\nWhat?\\nRandy\\nThe church is back open?\\nTownsman 3\\nOh boy! Let\\'s go let\\'s go let\\'s go let\\'s go!\\nOthers\\nThe church is back open! Thank God! Let\\'s go!\\nThe church, inside. The cleanup crew is there doing its work.\\nAuxiliary\\nScrub everything! Police can detect even a milligram of cum and rectal blood!\\nRandy\\n[enters with other bar patrons] Hey!\\nAuxiliary\\nOh uh, hello my children. The Lord be with you.\\nTownsmen\\nAnd with your spirit.\\nRandy\\nWhat uh, what are you guys doing?\\nAuxiliary\\nOh, we\\'re just giving the place a nice scrub down while we wait for your priest to come back. He was called to South America last week.\\nRandy\\nLast week? No, he was at my house a couple of days ago playing board games with the boys.\\nAuxiliary\\n[turns the vacuum cleaner off. His assistants look at Randy] No he wasn\\'t. Look, I assure you everything is fine. Your priest will be back. Just have some patience.\\nTownsmen\\nAwww.\\nTownsman 4\\nCome on, guys. [the townsmen turn around and leave]\\nThe Marsh house. Having spoken to Randy, the cleanup crew heads to his house and scrubs it down, They\\'re working on the table.\\nAuxiliary\\nScrub everything. Bleach those board-game pieces. You find something on that chair?\\nPriest\\nIt\\'s either blood and cum, or ketchup and mayo. [the priest is scrubbing down Cartman\\'s chair]\\nAuxiliary\\nWell, just get rid of it. Bleach the entire top of the table. That\\'s probably where he mounted them.\\nStan\\n[comes down the stairs and approaches the crew] Uh, excuse me.\\nAuxiliary\\n[turns to face him] Oh. Hello, my son.\\nStan\\nWhat are you doing?\\nAuxiliary\\nWhat are we doing about what?\\nStan\\nWell, I mean, it looks like you\\'re scrubbing and bleaching our tables and chairs.\\nAuxiliary\\nMmm mmm, that\\'s not what\\'s going on. Your local priest was never here, actually.\\nStan\\nYeah he was. I played with him.\\nAuxiliary\\nOh, you did! [whispers loudly to the priest behind him] Better get the Kumby. [the priest walks off]\\nStan\\nWhat\\'s a Kumby?\\nAuxiliary\\nWe\\'re just here to cleanse your spirit, my child.\\nPriest\\n[returns with an odd tool] Praise be to Christ. [the Kumby looks like a portable wet/dry vacuum cleaner worn like a backpack. The priest uses it to wipe Stan down]\\nKidZone Roller Rink, day. The kids sing \"Happy Birthday\" to Clyde. Clyde blows out the candles. In the background \"More Bounce To The Ounce\" plays\\nBoys\\nYaaay!\\nFr. Maxi\\nAnd now let us pray.\\nBoys\\nAwww.\\nFr. Maxi\\nBless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. which we are about to receive.\\nClyde\\nKyle, will you do something please?!\\nFr. Maxi\\n[quoting Psalm 78:26] He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens...\\nKyle\\nWhy me?\\nCartman\\n[gritting his teeth] Kyle!\\nFr. Maxi\\n...through Christ our Lord. Amen.\\nKyle\\n[walks up to Butters] Uh, Butters, can I talk to you really fast?\\nButters\\nWow! Sure, Kyle. Be right back, Father. [follows Kyle away]\\nFr. Maxi\\nAll right, my child.\\nA snack room nearby. Kyle waits for Butters there, and Butters walks in\\nButters\\nHuh-what\\'s up?\\nKyle\\nButters, you know, you can just bring your priest with you everywhere. I mean, sometimes the guys just wanna do stuff and not have a priest around.\\nButters\\nWhat are you saying, Kyle?\\nKyle\\nI\\'m saying it\\'s just kind of awkward, Butters. [Fr. Maxi goes to look for these two boys and just happens to walk by the snack room. He stops just short of the doorway and listens] He\\'s bumming everybody out. Nobody wants to hear about Jesus at a birthday party.\\nButters\\nWell, of course, you don\\'t.\\nKyle\\nIt\\'s not just me. It\\'s everyone, Butters. He can try all he wants, but he just doesn\\'t belong here. [Maxi\\'s face drops, then he walks away quietly]\\nButters\\nWell I\\'m sorry for tryin\\' to help out somebody who didn\\'t have anywhere else to turn. We\\'ll both just leave. I thought you were better than that, Kyle. [walks out]\\nKidZone Roller Rink, outside. A van arrives carrying the cleanup crew. The song they\\'re listening to is \"Faith In Christ,\" which played earlier. \"It\\'s a Love Thing\" starts as the cleanup crew fans out across the rink\\nAuxiliary\\nAll right, clean and scrub everything. I want it spotless! Get any evidence the priest might have left behind.\\nAssistant\\nThere\\'s something over here, [tastes the frosting on Clyde\\'s slice of cake] but I can\\'t tell if it\\'s cum or frosting.\\nAuxiliary\\nIt\\'s an 8-year-old\\'s birthday party. Of course, it\\'s cum. Get the Kumby!\\nPriest\\n[arrives with the Kumby and wipes Clyde down] Praise be to Christ.\\nAuxiliary\\n[approaches Cartman and wipes him down with a cloth. Cartman panics a bit] Hello, young man. We\\'re looking for your town priest. Was he here?\\nCartman\\nYeah, but he left with Butters.\\nAuxiliary\\nTell me about this Butters.\\nClyde\\nAll right, that does it! [the priest is now wiping down his back] Get out of my birthday party or else I\\'m gonna call the police! [the priest turns the Kumby off and stands up]\\nTwin Pines strip mall, day. Butters wanders the parking lot looking for Fr. Maxi.\\nButters\\nFather! Father? Has anybody seen my priest? Father, where\\'d you go? [Maxi is sitting by a Dumpster and raises his head when he hears Butters approaching. Butters then sees him] There you are! I\\'ve been looking everywhere.\\nFr. Maxi\\nJust leave me alone.\\nButters\\nBut you\\'re missin\\' the party!\\nFr. Maxi\\nLook, your friends are right, okay? I don\\'t belong there. I, I don\\'t belong anywhere. [gets up and walks away]\\nButters\\n[follows Maxi through the parking lot] But, they just don\\'t understand you like I do.\\nFr. Maxi\\nStop defending me! There are things you don\\'t know!\\nButters\\nBut it\\'s not your fault.\\nFr. Maxi\\nYes it is! It is my fault!\\nButters\\nWhy?!\\nFr. Maxi\\n[turns around and faces Butters] Because I knew, all right?! I knew! Years ago, when bad things started coming out about the Catholic Church, I went to the Vatican and ... I found out that the problem was worse than anyone even thought. I thought I could help fix it, so, I kept my mouth shut. I thought there was cancer in the Church that we could get rid of. But the Church is cancer. It\\'s not about a few bad apples. There are only a few good apples, and I\\'m clearly not one of them. So just stay away from me!\\nButters\\nBut... I thought we were pals.\\nFr. Maxi\\nYou thought wrong. [turns around and walks away. Butters shrinks a little in worry]\\nThe neighborhood, evening. Butters walks down the street with his head down. A vehicle comes up behind him - it\\'s the cleanup crew\\'s van. The auxiliary bishop looks out the window and gets Butters\\' attention\\nAuxiliary\\nHey. Hey there. What\\'s the matter, my child? Did you know that Jesus loves you?\\nButters\\nSometimes I wonder.\\nAuxiliary\\n\"And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me.\" [Galatians 2:20. He dangles a candy bar in front of Butters.] Want a Three Musketeers?\\nButters\\n...No thanks.\\nAuxiliary\\nYou like camping trips? You wanna go camping?\\nButters\\nNo.\\nAuxiliary\\nI got a bunny in the back. You wanna see the bunny?\\nButters\\n[perks up] Well, okay! [the bishop takes him to the back and opens the doors. Butters frowns] Stan?\\nStan\\nI have no idea what\\'s going on.\\nClyde\\nWorst birthday ever! [the priests toss Butters in to join Stan and Clyde, then slam the doors shut]\\nThe Marsh house. Randy watches TV, but doesn\\'t see anything he likes.\\nRandy\\nBoring [click] Dumb. [click] Stupid. [click] Good, but dated in its view of gender norms. [The doorbell rings and he slumps a bit] Wugh. [gets up and answers it. Fr. Maxi is at the door]\\nFr. Maxi\\nHello, Mr. Marsh.\\nRandy\\nFather! [turns around, dancing] Hey, hey Sharon, it\\'s Father!\\nFr. Maxi\\nM, Mr. Marsh-\\nRandy\\nHe\\'s back!\\nFr. Maxi\\n-please.\\nRandy\\nHey, Father\\'s back!\\nFr. Maxi\\nI\\'m just going around trying to locate little Butters Stotch. I thought he might be here playing a board game with your son?\\nRandy\\nOh uh, no. I haven\\'t seen, Butters. Or Stan. But Father, please, we all need church.\\nFr. Maxi\\nI\\'m sorry, but I have to keep looking. [turns around and leaves] I said some terrible things.\\nRandy\\nPlease, Father, we\\'re all lost, and the cleanup crew hasn\\'t helped at all.\\nFr. Maxi\\n[stops and turns around] What cleanup crew?\\nThe forest, night. Stan, Clyde, and Butters have been stripped and tied up, but have enough freedom to roast marshmallows. Wolves and owls are heard. The priests hide behind a bush nearby\\nAuxiliary\\nAny sign of him?\\nAssistant\\nNo, but this should draw him out. The cute one says it\\'s where he and the priest first got together.\\nAuxiliary\\nAll right, when the priest gets here, we\\'ll take care of him and then eradicate this place of any evidence.\\nPriest\\nShould I bring out the Kumby?\\nAuxiliary\\nNo, this is gonna be a bigger job than that. Bring out... the Kumboni. [moments later, the priest drives up in a Kumboni]\\nThe Stotch house, day. Stephen and Linda are sitting on the sofa watching TV. The phone rings and Stephen answers it.\\nStephen\\nHey Randy, what\\'s up?\\nRandy\\n[driving] Stephen! Stephen, listen! The boys are missing! Fr. Maxi thinks they\\'ve been taken by the other priests!\\nStephen\\n[jumps up from the sofa and walks away from it] Taken by priests?? Should we call the police or buy some condoms? [smiles]\\nRandy\\n[laughs] Okay. Okay-okay, that was good. [mood change] But seriously, we have to find these guys! The boys are in danger!\\nStephen\\nBut where would priests go this late at night?\\nLinda\\nTo a midnight sale at Boys \\'R\\' Us?\\nRandy\\nWhat-what\\'d she say?\\nStephen\\nShe said, \"To a midnight sale at Boys \\'R\\' Us.\"\\nRandy\\nCan, can I post that?\\nStephen\\nSure, she doesn\\'t care.\\nFr. Maxi\\n[grabs the phone from Randy] Give me that! Mr. Stotch, have you heard from Butters at all?!\\nStephen\\nWell yeah, we got a really weird text from him saying not to worry, he needed to do some camping.\\nFr. Maxi\\n[puts down the phone] Oh my Lord. I know where to go. And when we get there... I\\'ll need to go in alone.\\nRandy\\nYeah I\\'ll bet. [snickers]\\nThe forest clearing. The assistant looks around\\nAssistant\\nHe\\'s not showing up.\\nAuxiliary\\nTry the priest call. [the assistant pulls out a calling device similar to a duck call and blows into it]\\nKid\\'s voice\\nI love Jeeesus! I love Jeeesus!\\nAssistant\\n[turns around] I don\\'t think he\\'s coming.\\nAuxiliary\\nOh he\\'s coming all right. Just not here. Let\\'s start packing up. You. [points at the priest] Get on the Kumboni and eradicate this place along with everything in it.\\nPriest\\nYes, your Holiness.\\nFr. Maxi\\nWait! [arrives at the clearing]\\nButters\\nFather.\\nFr. Maxi\\nYou wanted to find me? Well, here I am. I know why you\\'re here. The Church can\\'t have... someone like me going around making it look bad. So go ahead. [turns away] Do it. Just get it over with.\\nButters\\nWhat?? No!\\nAuxiliary\\nYou think we searched all over town and set up this trap to kill you? We\\'re Catholics! We\\'re here to give you what you deserve! A full transfer to the beautiful Maldive Islands. Luxury airfare and beach house included! [theh other two priests applaued]\\nFr. Maxi\\nA transfer?\\nAuxiliary\\nThe Church took care of everything, just like it always has from the beginning. \"Thank you for cleaning up all my cum.\"\\nFr. Maxi\\nI can just... go? I can start over in the Maldives?\\nAuxiliary\\nNo one will make fun of you there. They can\\'t even speak English. And don\\'t worry, there\\'ll be plenty of priests to take your place here. Look, I know it\\'s a big change, but... you know what you have to do.\\nFr. Maxi\\nYes, I do. I don\\'t think I have any other choice.\\nButters\\nNo. He can\\'t.\\nAuxiliary\\nWell, our work here is done! Praise be to Christ, guys. It certainly was a tough one, but I think we got everything cleaned up and- [the Kumboni starts up and smashes through some trees. Fr. Maxi is driving it right at the priests.] Aaaaugh!\\nAssistant\\nThe Kumboni! Aaah! [Maxi mows him down and kills him] Aaaaagh! Aah!\\nPriest\\nAaaaugh! Aaaaugh! [Maxi mows him down and kills him]\\nAuxiliary\\n[Maxi is hot on his trail] No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. [Maxi mows him down, killing him. Moments later, Maxi stops the engine and walks up to the boys]\\nButters\\nFather, you did it!\\nFr. Maxi\\nI\\'m so sorry, my child. I never meant to say we weren\\'t pals.\\nButters\\nDoes that mean you\\'re gonna stay?\\nFr. Maxi\\nOf course. Now I have purpose, and I have meaning. My job here is to protect you. All of you.\\nThe church, Sunday morning. The doors open and Fr. Maxi is back in his robes looking at the congregants\\nFr. Maxi\\nThe Lord be with you.\\nCongregants\\nAnd with your spirit. [they go in]\\nAfter the Gospel, Fr. Maxi launches into his sermon\\nFr. Maxi\\nToday I\\'d like to talk on the subject of penance. The penitent... have deep remorse, but for true penance, we must be humble enough to admit that the Lord\\'s forgiveness is undeserved.\\nRandy\\nKind of like how getting raped by a Catholic priest is undeserved. [all laugh]\\nFr. Maxi\\nIn Job 42:6 we read \"Therefore, I reprehend myself and do penance in dust and ashes\"\\nTownsman 1\\nAnd in choir boys\\' butts and asses. [all laugh]\\nFr. Maxi\\nSo we are not to punish ourselves, but instead, we are to make ourselves passionate.\\nTownsman 5\\nLike a Catholic priest at a Chuck E. Cheese. [all laugh]\\nRandy\\nOh God, it\\'s good to have my faith back!\\nFr. Maxi\\nPassionate to understand all that Christ sacrificed, and how hard it truly was.\\nWoman 4\\nHow hard what truly was?
